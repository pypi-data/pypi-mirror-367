GrapaPy is a Python extension for the Grapa language, designed for advanced data processing, ETL, and language experimentation. GrapaPy brings robust, production-ready parallel ETL/data processing to Python. By leveraging Grapa's C++ backend, GrapaPy enables true parallelism for high-throughput data workflows—bypassing Python's GIL and making advanced data processing simple and fast.

## Platform Support

GrapaPy supports the following platforms:
- **Windows**: AMD64 (x86_64) - Requires Visual Studio Build Tools or Visual Studio
- **macOS**: AMD64 (x86_64) and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) - Requires Xcode Command Line Tools
- **Linux**: AMD64 (x86_64) and ARM64 - Requires GCC and development libraries

## Installation

```bash
# Windows
pip install grapapy

# macOS/Linux
pip3 install grapapy
```

## Features
- True parallel ETL/data processing from Python
- Hardened, production-ready parallelism
