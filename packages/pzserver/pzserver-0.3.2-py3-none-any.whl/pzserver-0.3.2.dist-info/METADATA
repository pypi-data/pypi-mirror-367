A Python library to access data and services from the LSST [Photo-z Server](https://pz-server-dev.linea.org.br/). 

The Photo-z (PZ) Server is an online service based on software developed and delivered as part of the in-kind contribution program BRA-LIN, from LIneA to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) caried out by the [Rubin Observatory](https://rubinobservatory.org/). The PZ Server is an open source project. The source code is available on the GitHub repository [linea-it/pzserver_app](https://github.com/linea-it/pzserver_app). 
 
An overview of this and other contributions is available [here](https://linea-it.github.io/pz-lsst-inkind-doc/).  
The API documentation is available [here](https://linea-it.github.io/pzserver). 


This repo uses the [LINCC's Python Project Template](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/python-project-template), described in the article: [A Python Project Template for Healthy Scientific Software](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ad4da1).

## Instructions for developers: 

### How to validate a PR 

Step-by-step procedure to test a new feature or bug fix from a particular branch not using a previously installed version (not the only way, just a suggestion): 

1. Clone the repository (first time only).
 
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:linea-it/pzserver.git
    # or git clone https://github.com/linea-it/pzserver.git
    ```
</p>

2. Enter the repository and checkout to the development branch.

    ```
    cd pzserver
    git fetch origin
    git checkout <development branch name>
    git pull
    ```
</p>
    
3. Create a new Conda environment free from `pzserver`  old version installation. Delete any existing one with the same same, if necessary. 

    ```
    conda remove --name pzserver-dev --all
    conda create -n pzserver-dev
    conda activate pzserver-dev
    conda install pip
    pip install -e '.[dev]'
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name pzserver-dev --display-name "Python (pzserver-dev)"
    ```
</p>

4. Open Python prompt or notebook and import the library:

    ```
    from pzserver import PzServer
    token = "****"  # your toker 
    host = "pz-dev" # or "localhost" if testing pipeline back-end locally
    pz = PzServer(token, host)                                   
    ```
