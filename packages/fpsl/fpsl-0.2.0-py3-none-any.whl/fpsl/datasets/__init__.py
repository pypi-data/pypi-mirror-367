"""
This submodule provides a suite of one-dimensional potential energy landscapes and their
corresponding biased-force variants for use in score-based and diffusion-based modeling
experiments. Each dataset class encapsulates a specific analytic potential function and
supporting machinery to generate samples, compute energies, and (where applicable)
apply an external biasing force.

The following [DataSet][fpsl.datasets.DataSet] classes are included:

- [**WPotential1D**][fpsl.datasets.WPotential1D]
    A symmetric double-well (W-shaped) potential in one dimension.
- [**BiasedForceWPotential1D**][fpsl.datasets.BiasedForceWPotential1D]
    The WPotential1D with an added constant biasing force term.
- [**ToyMembranePotential1D**][fpsl.datasets.ToyMembranePotential1D]
    A simple membrane-like potential featuring a central barrier and flanking wells.
- [**BiasedForceToyMembranePotential1D**][fpsl.datasets.BiasedForceToyMembranePotential1D]
    The ToyMembranePotential1D augmented with an external biasing force.
- [**ToyMembrane2Potential1D**][fpsl.datasets.ToyMembrane2Potential1D]
    An extended membrane potential with two barriers and three wells.
- [**BiasedForceToyMembrane2Potential1D**][fpsl.datasets.BiasedForceToyMembrane2Potential1D]
    The ToyMembrane2Potential1D with an additional biasing force.
- [**ToyMembrane3Potential1D**][fpsl.datasets.ToyMembrane3Potential1D]
    A higher-order membrane potential featuring three barriers and four wells.
- [**BiasedForceToyMembrane3Potential1D**][fpsl.datasets.BiasedForceToyMembrane3Potential1D]
    The ToyMembrane3Potential1D augmented with an external biasing force.

All classes expose a consistent interface for:
    • Sampling data points from the potential's Boltzmann distribution.
    • Computing potential energies and (optional) biasing forces.
    • Integrating seamlessly with score-based learning workflows.

Usage example:

    dataset = WPotential1D(num_samples=10000, temperature=1.0)
    x, energy = dataset.sample()
