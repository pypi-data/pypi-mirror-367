The oops_timeline package provides integration glue between timeline objects
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/timeline) and the oops error reporting system
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/oops).

Dependencies
============

* Python 3.8+

* oops (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/oops)

* timeline (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/timeline)

Testing Dependencies
====================

* subunit (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-subunit) (optional)

* testtools (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools)

Usage
=====

oops_timeline provides an oops on_create hook to extract timeline data from
oops_context['timeline'] and inject it into the oops report as primitive data.

* Setup your configuration::

  >>> from oops import Config
  >>> config = Config()

Note that you will probably want at least one publisher, or your reports will
be discarded.

* Add in the timeline hook to the config::

  >>> oops_timeline.install_hooks(config)

This is a convenience function in case additional hooks are needed in future.

For more information see pydoc oops_timeline.

Installation
============

python-oops-timeline can be installed into an existing Python environment in
the usual way using ``pip``, or it can be installed as a standalone package.
To install it as a standalone package, run ``make`` to create a suitable virtual
environment.

Development
===========

Upstream development takes place at https://launchpad.net/python-oops-timeline.
To setup a working area for development, if the dependencies are not
immediately available, you can use `make` to create a virtual environment, then
env/bin/python3 to get a python interpreter with the dependencies available.

To run the tests use tox.

For instance::

  $ tox
