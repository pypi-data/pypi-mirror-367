# ELX

ðŸš§ Under construction

A lightweight Python interface for extracting and loading using the Singer.io spec.

âš¡ Lazy install of Singer.io taps and targets \
âš¡ Stream parallelism for high performance \
âš¡ Remote state management \
âš¡ Tap catalog is available in Python for metadata purposes

ðŸ”— Native integration with Dagster \
ðŸ”— Native integration with Airflow (todo) \
ðŸ”— Native integration with Prefect (todo)

## Installation

```bash
pip install elx --pre
```

## Usage

The most basic usage is as follows. Simply define the Tap and the Target and elx will take care of the rest.

```python
from elx import Runner, Tap, Target

runner = Runner(
  Tap("git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-carbon-intensity.git"),
  Target("target-jsonl")
)

runner.run()
```

### Configuration

You can configure the tap and target by passing a `config` dictionary to the `Tap` and `Target` constructors. The config will be injected into the tap and target at runtime.

```python
from elx import Tap, Target

tap = Tap(
  "tap-foo",
  config={
    "api_key": "1234567890",
    "start_date": "2020-01-01"
  }
)

target = Target(
  "target-bar",
  config={
    "file_path": "/tmp"
  }
)
```

### De-selecting streams and properties

You can modify the selected streams and properties of the tap by passing a `deselected` list to the Tap constructor. To deselect an entire stream, you specifiy the `<stream_name>`. To just deselect a stream property, specify the `<stream_name.property_name>`.

```python
from elx import Tap

tap = Tap(
  "tap-foo",
  config={...},
  deselected=[
    "users", # deselects the entire `users` stream
    "customers.name", # deselects the `name` property from the `customers` stream
  ]
)
```

### Replication keys

To facilitate incremental loading, the Tap constructor allows you to include a `replication_keys` dictionary. This dictionary should contain key-value pairs representing the stream names and their respective replication keys.

```python
from elx import Tap

tap = Tap(
  "tap-foo",
  config={...},
  replication_keys={
    "users": "updated_at", # sets `updated_at` column as replication key for `users` stream
  }
)
```

### State

By default, elx will store the state in the same directory as the script that is running. You can override this by passing a `StateManager` to the `Runner` constructor. Behind the scenes, elx uses [smart-open](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/smart_open) to be able to store the state in a variety of locations.

```python
from elx import Runner, StateManager

runner = Runner(
  tap,
  target,
  state_manager=StateManager("s3://my-bucket/my-folder")
)
```

Supported paths include:

| Path                                                   | Required Environment Variables                         | Elx Extra    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `s3://my-bucket/my-folder`                             | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`        | `elx[s3]`    |
| `gs://my-bucket/my-folder`                             | `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or `GOOGLE_API_TOKEN` | `elx[gs]`    |
| `azure://my-bucket/my-folder`                          | `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`                      | `elx[azure]` |
| `~/my-folder`                                          | `None`                                                 | `None`       |
| `/tmp/my-folder`                                       | `None`                                                 | `None`       |
| `(ssh\|scp\|sftp)://username@host//my-folder`          | `None`                                                 | `None`       |
| `(ssh\|scp\|sftp)://username:password@host//my-folder` | `None`                                                 | `None`       |

### Config injection
There are certain variables that are available to inject in the tap or target config. One common use case is to place the tap data in a schema with the tap name.

```python
target = Target(
  "target-bar",
  config={
    "default_target_schema": "{TAP_NAME}"
  }
)
```

Supported variables:

| Variable            | Example                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `NOW`               | `2023-08-17T11:06:54.233086` |
| `YESTERDAY`         | `2023-08-16T11:06:54.233086` |
| `LAST_WEEK`         | `2023-08-10T11:06:54.233086` |
| `TAP_EXECUTABLE`    | `tap-smoke-test`             |
| `TAP_NAME`          | `tap_smoke_test`             |
| `TARGET_EXECUTABLE` | `target-postgres`            |
| `TARGET_NAME`       | `target_postgres`            |
