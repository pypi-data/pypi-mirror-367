## Installation

### Linux with Snap

On Linux the only currently supported method is Snap:

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/en/light/install.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/rayforge)

To be able to use your camera, you will then have to run this once:

```bash
snap connect rayforge:camera
```

### Linux with PIP

Advanced users may also install it through PIP, but know what you are doing. Something like this:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip-whl python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-adw-1 gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0 libgirepository-1.0-dev libgirepository-2.0-0 libvips42t64 libpotrace-dev libagg-dev libadwaita-1-0 libopencv-dev

pip3 install rayforge
```

### ~~Linux with Flatpak~~

Unfortunately this does not work yet. I would love for someone to fix it up, see [flatpak](flatpak/).
What would be needed is a Github workflow that publishes the Flatpak. I tried many hours trying
to get this to work, but did not find a way.

### Windows

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/barebaric/rayforge/releases/).

### Other operating systems

There is currently no installer for other operating systems - contributions are
welcome, in the form of Github workflow actions or build instructions.

If you know what you are doing, you may be able to install manually using
PIP on Windows or Mac - the source code should be fully cross-platform.

## Development

Setup:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip-whl python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-adw-1 libgirepository-1.0-dev libgirepository-2.0-0 libvips42t64
git clone git@github.com:barebaric/rayforge.git
cd rayforge
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Driver development

If you want to develop a driver to support your machine with Rayforge,
please check the [driver development guide](docs/driver.md).
