# Longbow

Longbow is an automated simulation submission and monitoring tool. Longbow
is designed to reproduce the look and feel of using software on the users
local computer with the difference that the heavy lifting is done by a
supercomputer.

Longbow will automatically generate the necessary submit files and handle all
initial file transfer, monitor jobs, transfer files at configurable
intervals and perform final file transfer and cleanup.

Longbow can be used to launch one-off jobs, generate ensembles of similar jobs
or even run many different jobs over many different supercomputers.

Out of the box, Longbow is currently supporting the PBS/Torque, LSF, SGE,
Slurm, SoGE schedulers and ships with application plugins for commonly used
bio-molecular simulation softwares AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS, NAMD.
Longbow is however highly configurable and will function normally with generic
software without plugins, however plugins can easily be made to extend Longbow
to fully support applications and schedulers that do not ship out of the box.

Using Longbow can be as simple as the following example:

local: executable -a arg1 -b arg2 -c arg3

remote: longbow executable -a arg1 -b arg2 -c arg3

Longbow is also available to developers of applications which require support
for automating job submission. Longbow is available as a convenient and
light-weight python API that can be integrated in a number of different way.
