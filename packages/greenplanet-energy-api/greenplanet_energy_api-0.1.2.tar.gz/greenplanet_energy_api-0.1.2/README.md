## Features

- Async/await support
- Fetch hourly electricity prices for today and tomorrow
- Handles German decimal formatting 
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type hints for better IDE support
- Lightweight with minimal dependencies

## Installation

```bash
pip install greenplanet-energy-api
```

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from greenplanet_energy_api import GreenPlanetEnergyAPI

async def main():
    async with GreenPlanetEnergyAPI() as api:
        # Get electricity prices for today and tomorrow
        prices = await api.get_electricity_prices()
        
        # Access today's prices
        for hour in range(24):
            price_key = f"gpe_price_{hour:02d}"
            if price_key in prices:
                print(f"Hour {hour:02d}: {prices[price_key]} €/kWh")
        
        # Access tomorrow's prices
        for hour in range(24):
            price_key = f"gpe_price_{hour:02d}_tomorrow"
            if price_key in prices:
                print(f"Tomorrow Hour {hour:02d}: {prices[price_key]} €/kWh")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
