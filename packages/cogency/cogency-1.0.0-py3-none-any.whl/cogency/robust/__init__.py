"""Resilience capabilities.

This module provides resilience features built on resilient-result:

- checkpoint: Decorator for checkpointing functions
- checkpointer: Checkpointing utility class
- resume: Function to resume from checkpoints

These capabilities enable agents to handle failures gracefully and resume
execution from known good states.
