# Human-Like Auto Typer

A smart auto-typing desktop app that mimics human behavior — with typos, backspaces, customizable speed, and even live stats. Built using Python and Tkinter.

---

## 🔥 Features

- ⌨️ **Human-like typing**: Simulates natural typing with mistakes and corrections
- 🕒 **Custom timing**: Set total typing time or WPM (words per minute)
- 🎯 **Hotkeys**: 
  - Start typing on your chosen key (default: `F4`)
  - Pause/resume typing (default: `F2`)
  - Stop typing anytime with `ESC`
- 🌙 **Dark mode toggle**
- 📊 **Live statistics**: Characters typed, time elapsed, typing speed
- 🪟 **Floating mini-window**: Always-on-top status display (optional)

### Note

- The timing isnt correct enough because there are multiple factors affecting time (the mistakes and their correction, wpm, how many characters, the time given)

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `keyboard` package:
  ```bash
  pip install keyboard
  
### How to start the code
Download auto writer.py
```bash
