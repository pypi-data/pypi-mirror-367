# asyncio (obsolete backport)

This package once provided a backport of the `asyncio` module for Python
versions prior to 3.4. The `asyncio` module has shipped with the Python
standard library since Python 3.4 and this separate distribution is no longer
needed.

**Do not install this package.** Use the implementation that comes with
Python instead:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html

This release contains no code and exists only to prevent accidental
installation of outdated backports.
