A dataclass drop-in that allows you to define individual fields as immutable.

## Usage

Simply replace all your `dataclasses` imports with `semimutable`, and use `field(frozen=True)` for the fields you want to be immutable.

`field` takes in the same parameters as `dataclasses.field`, with an extra `frozen` boolean flag that defaults to `False`. You can specify default values, default factories, and other options just like you would with a regular dataclass field.

Here is one example from our tests.

```python
from semimutable import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Simple:
    x: int = field(frozen=True)
    y: int = 0 # normal, mutable field

def test_frozen_field_is_immutable():
    obj = Simple(x=1, y=2)
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        obj.x = 99

def test_non_frozen_field_is_mutable():
    obj = Simple(x=1, y=2)
    obj.y = 42
    assert obj.y == 42
```
