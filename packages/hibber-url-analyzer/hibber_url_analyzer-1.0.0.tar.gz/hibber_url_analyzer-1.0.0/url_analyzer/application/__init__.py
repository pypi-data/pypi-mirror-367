"""
Application Layer for URL Analyzer

This package contains the application-specific business rules and use cases
for the URL Analyzer application. It orchestrates the flow of data to and from
the domain layer and defines interfaces for infrastructure services.

The application layer depends only on the domain layer and not on any
external frameworks or infrastructure concerns.
