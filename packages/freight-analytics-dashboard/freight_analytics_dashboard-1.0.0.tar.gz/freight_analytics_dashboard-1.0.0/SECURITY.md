## Reporting a Vulnerability

### 🔐 **How to Report**

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Advanced US Freight Analytics Dashboard, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **Email directly**: [Your Security Email]
3. **Include details**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### ⏱️ **Response Timeline**

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues within 2 weeks, others within 30 days
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and tested

### 🛡️ **Security Measures**

#### **Data Protection**
- ✅ No sensitive personal data is collected
- ✅ All data sources are publicly available datasets
- ✅ No authentication or user data storage
- ✅ Client-side processing only

#### **Code Security**
- ✅ Input validation for all user inputs
- ✅ Secure file handling with error boundaries
- ✅ No code execution from user inputs
- ✅ Dependencies regularly updated

#### **Deployment Security**
- ✅ HTTPS encryption in production
- ✅ Streamlit Cloud security standards
- ✅ No exposed sensitive configurations
- ✅ Regular dependency vulnerability scans

### 🚨 **Known Security Considerations**

#### **Low Risk Items**
1. **File Uploads**: Not supported - reduces attack surface
2. **User Authentication**: Not implemented - no user data exposure
3. **Database Access**: No database connections - file-based only
4. **API Keys**: None required for current functionality

#### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Input sanitization for all data processing
- Error handling prevents information disclosure
- Rate limiting through Streamlit Cloud infrastructure
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot

### 📊 **Data Privacy**

#### **Data Sources**
- USDA Agricultural Transportation (Public)
- Port Authority Websites (Public)
- Bureau of Transportation Statistics (Public)

#### **User Privacy**
- No personal information collected
- No cookies or tracking
- No user analytics beyond Streamlit defaults
- No data persistence between sessions
