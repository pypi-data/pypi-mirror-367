# VAIRO
Guiding structural model predictions with experimental information

-------------------

## Prerequisites
* AlphaFold2
* HH-suite
* CCP4 suite
* ALEPH
* MAXIT

-------------------

## Installation

In order to install VAIRO and its interface VAIROGUI, you need to run the installer script located in tools/install_vairo.sh. This script handles conda setup and installs all VAIRO dependencies within a dedicated environment.

Execute the installer script:
```
bash tools/install_vairo.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check for an existing conda installation and install it if missing.
2. Create and activate a conda environment for VAIRO.
3. Install all Python and system dependencies required by VAIRO.
4. Verify that system libraries like CUDA drivers or MAXIT are already present.

-------------------

## Usage

To run the command-line program:

```
vairo [-h] [-check] <config.yaml>
```

| Flag      | Description                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| `-h`      | Show help and exit                             |
| `-check`  | Validate configuration (*.yml*) file parsing   |    


To launch the graphical interface:
```
vairogui
```
