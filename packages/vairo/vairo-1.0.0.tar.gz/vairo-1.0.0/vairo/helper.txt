      mutations (map) Map three-letter amino acid codes to residue indices. Example:

      strict (boolean, default: true) Discard templates with E-values below threshold.
      aligned (boolean, default: false) Skip alignment if already aligned.
      legacy (boolean, default: false) Use pre-aligned, single-chain template for the full query.
      reference (string, default: null) Reference to be used in order to insert it into the query sequence.
      modifications (List) Chain-level edits before/after alignment. Each modification can include:
         - chain (string, mandatory) chain ID or All.
           position (integer, default: null) Insertion position in query (if single chain).
           maintain_residues (list of integers, default: null) Selected residues will be kept, and the rest will be deleted.
           delete_residues (list of integers, default: null) Selected residues will be deleted, the rest will be kept.
           when (string, default: after_alignment) before_alignment or after_alignment.
           mutations (List) Modifications in the residues:
              - numbering_residues (list of integers, mandatory) Residue positions where the mutations will be applied.
                mutate_with (string, mandatory) The amino acid to mutate to, specified as a three‑letter code or as a FASTA file path.

Merge or slice existing features.pkl files from other AlphaFold2 runs into your run.
features:
    - path (string, mandatory) Path to an existing features.pkl file.
      keep_msa (integer, default: -1) -1 = all sequences; otherwise top X by coverage.
