            To solve the folding problem, the attention algorithm, encoded
            in the transformer succeeded in relating pairwise evolutionary
            conservation and structural data in the PDB. AlphaFold succeeded in
            harnessing this knowledge, in many cases matching the accuracy of
            close homologs in its predictions, as assessed in CASP14 experiments.
            AlphaFold derives information from three sources: learned parameters
            capturing intrinsic amino acid secondary structure and environment
            propensity; models of related proteins providing structural templates;
            and aligned sequences encoding profiles and concerted evolutionary
            changes of residues involved in contacts. Our method uses these three
            channels to include prior knowledge, through site-specific variants,
            predefined alignments and templates.

            We have implemented a way to analyze and modify the information
            underlying AlphaFold predictions. Our program, VAIRO, allows to
            selectively constrain structure conferring targeted degrees of freedom
            and setting boundary conditions. I will demonstrate how to use it in
            order to integrate predictions and biochemical and structural data as
            a route to broadly relate knowledge across experimental cases.
