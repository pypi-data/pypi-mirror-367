                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

When we talk about free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you are notified of your rights.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensor" refers to the individual, individuals, or organization that offers you the Program under these terms.

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making changes to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   "You" means the licensee in the copyright notice.

1. Source Code.

   The Licensor must make the source code available to you under the terms of this License.

2. Object Code.

   You may not distribute the object code of the Program unless you also distribute the source code.

3. Distribution.

   You may distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; and this License; and the following disclaimer:

    "This program comes with no warranty, to the extent permitted by law. For details, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>."

4. Modification.

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of this License, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License will not apply to parts of the work that are not derived from the Program.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started receiving commands, to print or display an appropriate copyright notice; and this License; and the following disclaimer:

    "This program comes with no warranty, to the extent permitted by law. For details, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>."

5. Copyleft.

   You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License will not apply to parts of the work that are not derived from the Program.

6. Warranty Disclaimer.

   The Program is licensed "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Program or the use or other dealings in the Program.

7. Limitation of Liability.

   In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the authors, copyright holders, or any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Program be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Program to operate with any other programs), even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

8. Interpretation.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided in this License should be held to be unenforceable, then all liability shall be borne by the licensee.

9. Acceptance.

   By copying, modifying, or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you accept this license and agree to be bound by its terms.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
