"""Package entry-point wrapper.

Executed when the user runs ``python -m agentfoundry`` or when a PyInstaller
binary launches the frozen application.  The module performs two distinct
phases:

1. Run the lightweight *bootstrap* checks (licence + critical env vars)
   without importing any sub-packages that might trigger the loading of
   compiled extensions.
2. Import and start the heavy-weight orchestration layer only after the
   environment has been validated.
