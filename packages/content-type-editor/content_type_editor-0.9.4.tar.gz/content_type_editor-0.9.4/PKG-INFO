# AsciiDoc Content Type Editor

**content-type-editor** is a web user interface that allows the user to add the `_mod-docs-content-type` attribute to a large number of AsciiDoc files that follow the guidelines for modules as defined in the [Modular Documentation Reference Guide](https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/). If the content type can be reliably recognized from the file name or its contents, it provides it as a suggestion which the user can apply. If the content type is ambiguous, it displays analysis of the module content to help the user make the correct choice.
