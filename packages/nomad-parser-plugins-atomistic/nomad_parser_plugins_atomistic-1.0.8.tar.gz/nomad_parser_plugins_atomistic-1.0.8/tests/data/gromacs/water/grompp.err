GROMACS:      gmx grompp, VERSION 5.1.4
Executable:   /Users/bonat/GROMACS/BUILD/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /Users/bonat/GROMACS/BUILD
Command line:
  gmx_mpi grompp -f ./grompp.mdp -c ./conf -p ./topol -maxwarn 10

Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'optimize_fft'
Replacing old mdp entry 'verlet-buffer-drift' by 'verlet-buffer-tolerance'
Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'
Replacing old mdp entry 'xtc_precision' by 'compressed-x-precision'

NOTE 1 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  The group cutoff scheme is deprecated since GROMACS 5.0 and will be
  removed in a future release when all interaction forms are supported for
  the verlet scheme. The verlet scheme already scales better, and it is
  compatible with GPUs and other accelerators.


NOTE 2 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  The Berendsen thermostat does not generate the correct kinetic energy
  distribution. You might want to consider using the V-rescale thermostat.


WARNING 1 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  coulombtype = Switch is only for testing purposes and can lead to serious
  artifacts, advice: use coulombtype = Reaction-Field-zero


NOTE 3 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  The switch/shift interaction settings are just for compatibility; you
  will get better performance from applying potential modifiers to your
  interactions!



NOTE 4 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  For energy conservation with switch/shift potentials, rlist should be 0.1
  to 0.3 nm larger than rcoulomb.

Generated 330891 of the 330891 non-bonded parameter combinations
Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Generated 330891 of the 330891 1-4 parameter combinations
Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'SOL'
Velocities were taken from a Maxwell distribution at 0 K
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 1296.00

WARNING 2 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  You are not using center of mass motion removal (mdp option comm-mode),
  numerical rounding errors can lead to build up of kinetic energy of the
  center of mass


NOTE 5 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  The sum of the two largest charge group radii (0.168872) is larger than
  rlist (0.800000) - rcoulomb (0.800000).
  With exact cut-offs, better performance can be obtained with
  cutoff-scheme = Verlet, because it does not use charge groups at all.
