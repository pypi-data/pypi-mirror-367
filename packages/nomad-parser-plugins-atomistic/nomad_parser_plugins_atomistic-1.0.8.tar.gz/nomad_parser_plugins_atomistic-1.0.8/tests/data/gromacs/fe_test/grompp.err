GROMACS:      gmx grompp, VERSION 5.1.4
Executable:   /Users/bonat/GROMACS/BUILD/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /Users/bonat/GROMACS/BUILD
Command line:
  gmx_mpi grompp -f ./grompp.mdp -c ./conf -p ./topol -maxwarn 10

Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'optimize_fft'
Replacing old mdp entry 'verlet-buffer-drift' by 'verlet-buffer-tolerance'
Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'
Replacing old mdp entry 'xtc_precision' by 'compressed-x-precision'

WARNING 1 [file ./grompp.mdp, line 343]:
  You are using soft-core interactions while the Van der Waals interactions
  are not decoupled (note that the sc-coul option is only active when using
  lambda states). Although this will not lead to errors, you will need much
  more sampling than without soft-core interactions. Consider using
  sc-alpha=0.


NOTE 1 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  The group cutoff scheme is deprecated since GROMACS 5.0 and will be
  removed in a future release when all interaction forms are supported for
  the verlet scheme. The verlet scheme already scales better, and it is
  compatible with GPUs and other accelerators.


NOTE 2 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  With PME there is a minor soft core effect present at the cut-off,
  proportional to (LJsigma/rcoulomb)^6. This could have a minor effect on
  energy conservation, but usually other effects dominate. With a common
  sigma value of 0.34 nm the fraction of the particle-particle potential at
  the cut-off at lambda=0.5 is around 1.5e-04, while ewald-rtol is 1.0e-05.


NOTE 3 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, setting
  nstcomm to nstcalcenergy


NOTE 4 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  The Berendsen thermostat does not generate the correct kinetic energy
  distribution. You might want to consider using the V-rescale thermostat.

Generated 165 of the 1596 non-bonded parameter combinations

WARNING 2 [file topol.top, line 48]:
  Some parameters for bonded interaction involving perturbed atoms are
  specified explicitly in state A, but not B - copying A to B

Excluding 3 bonded neighbours molecule type 'Protein'
Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'SOL'
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 3045.00
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.48
