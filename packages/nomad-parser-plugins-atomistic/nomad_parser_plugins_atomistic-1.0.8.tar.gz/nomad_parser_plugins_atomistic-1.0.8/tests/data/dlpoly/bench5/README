Benchmark 5

Simulation of a sodium-potassium disilicate glass. Used Ewald sum
electrostatics, a multiple timestep algorithm and a three-body valence
angle potentials to support the silicate structure. It also using
tabluated two-body potentials stored in the file TABLE. The system is
comprised of 8640 atoms and runs on 16-512 processors.
