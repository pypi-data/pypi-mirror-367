One visually appealing way to present the high-level sections of the documentation is to include [grid cards](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/grids/). There are many different icons available and the cards can be combined with other MkDocs formatting, such as content tabs, code blocks, or lists. This is an illustrative example; you may add or remove grid cards to best meet the needs of your documentation set.
