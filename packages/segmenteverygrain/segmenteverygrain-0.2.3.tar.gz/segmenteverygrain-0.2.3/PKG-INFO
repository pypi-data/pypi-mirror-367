Dynamic: summary

'segmenteverygrain' is a Python package that aims to detect grains (or grain-like objects) in images. 
The goal is to develop an ML model that does a reasonably good job at detecting most of the grains in a photo, 
so that it will be useful for determining grain size and grain shape, a common task in geomorphology and sedimentary geology.
