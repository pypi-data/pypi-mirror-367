A collection of *English*, *Math*, and *Utility* tools, made for students.

---

Recommended to be used with **Python 3.12**.

For some reason it refuses to work with 3.13 even though all the modules it uses say they have support for 3.13! Because of this I have decided to limit the module to not be able to be installed with 3.13 because you won't be able to use it anyway!

**Requires** `sympy` and `pyfiglet`.

`cmd` > `pip install sympy pyfiglet`

**Package name:** student_tools

**Install with:** `pip install student-tools`

**Update with:** `pip install --upgrade student-tools`

**Use with:** `import st`

---

For a list of commands, use `st.cmds()`. I recommend using `st.info()` instead.
