# Run DMARC Milter with Postfix

## Steps

1. Install pydmarc, e.g. like this from sources:

   ```console
   $ git clone https://gitlab.com/duobradovic/pydmarc.git
   $ cd pydmarc

   # N.B. You may want to create and activate a Python virtualenv at this point.

   # This installs the package at the current location (`.`) with the `milter` option
   # to indicate extra dependencies to be installed.
   $ python -m pip install -e .[milter]
   ```

2. Run `dmarc.milter` module, bound to the loopback interface.

   ```console
   $ python -m dmarc.milter \
       --bind-host 127.0.0.1 \
       --bind-port 9000 \
       --log-level=INFO
   ```
  
   ðŸ’¡ Add `--config-file` parameter to load configuration file,
   see -- [`conf/`](conf/dmarcmilter.toml).
   
   ðŸ’¡ Change `--log-level=INFO` to `--log-level=DEBUG` and be ready to get a lot of
   output, perhaps relevant when testing.

2. Configure a Postfix instance.

   ```console
   $ postconf -e 'smtpd_milters = inet:127.0.0.1:9000'
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. `dmarc.milter` module consumes any discovered Authentication-Results Header (RFC 7601)
fields that claims to have been added within its trust boundary.

2. MTA MUST delete or otherwise obscure any instance of this header field
bearing an authentication service identifier indicating that the header field
was added within its trust boundary.

3. For simplicity and maximum security, a border MTA could remove all
instances of this header field on mail crossing into its trust boundary:

    ```console
    $ postconf -e 'header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks'
    $ echo '/^Authentication-Results:/   IGNORE' >> /etc/postfix/header_checks
    ```
