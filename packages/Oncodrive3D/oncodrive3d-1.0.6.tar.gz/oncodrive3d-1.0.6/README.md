# Oncodrive3D

**Oncodrive3D** is a fast and accurate computational method designed to analyze patterns of somatic mutation across tumors, with the goal of identifying **three-dimensional (3D) clusters** of missense mutations and detecting genes under **positive selection**. 

The method leverages **AlphaFold 2-predicted protein structures** and Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) to define residue contacts within the protein's 3D space. When available, it integrates **mutational profiles** to build an accurate background model of neutral mutagenesis. By applying a novel **rank-based statistical approach**, Oncodrive3D scores potential 3D clusters and computes empirical p-values.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure **Python 3.10 or later** is installed on your system.  
Additionally, you may need to install additional development tools. Depending on your environment, you can choose one of the following methods:

- If you have sudo privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install built-essential
   ```

- For HPC cluster environment, it is recommended to use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) (or [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)):

   ```bash
   conda create -n o3d python=3.10.0
   conda activate o3d
   conda install -c conda-forge gxx gcc libxcrypt clang zlib
   ```


## Installation

- Install via PyPI:

   ```bash
   pip install oncodrive3d
   ```

- Alternatively, you can obtain the latest code from the repository and install it for development with pip:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bbglab/oncodrive3d.git
   cd oncodrive3d
   pip install -e .
   oncodrive3d --help
   ```

- Or you can use a modern build tool like [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bbglab/oncodrive3d.git
   cd oncodrive3d
   uv run oncodrive3d --help
   ```

## Building Datasets

This step build the datasets necessary for Oncodrive3D to run the 3D clustering analysis. It is required once after installation or whenever you need to generate datasets for a different organism or apply a specific threshold to define amino acid contacts.

> [!WARNING]
> This step is highly time- and resource-intensive, requiring a significant amount of free disk space and computational power. It will download and process a large amount of data. Ensure sufficient resources are available before proceeding, as insufficient capacity may result in extended runtimes or processing failures.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time that you run Oncodrive3D building dataset step with a given reference genome, it will download it from our servers. By default the downloaded datasets go to`~/.bgdata`. If you want to move these datasets to another folder you have to define the system environment variable `BGDATA_LOCAL` with an export command.

```

    oncodrive3d build-datasets -o <build_folder>

> [!TIP]
> ### Increasing MANE Structural Coverage
> To maximize structural coverage of **MANE Select transcripts**, you can predict missing structures locally and integrate them into Oncodrive3D using:
>
> - `tools/preprocessing/prepare_samplesheet.py`: a standalone utility that:
>   - Retrieve the full MANE entries from NCBI.
>   - Identifies proteins missing from the AlphaFold MANE dataset.
>   - Generates:
>     - A `samplesheet.csv` with Ensembl protein IDs, FASTA paths, and optional sequences.
>     - Individual FASTA files for each missing protein.
>
> - `--custom_mane_pdb_dir`: use this to provide your own predicted PDB structures (e.g., from [nf-core/proteinfold](https://nf-co.re/proteinfold/1.0.0/)).
>
> - `--custom_mane_metadata_path`: path to the corresponding `samplesheet.csv`, which must include:
>   - `sequence`: Ensembl protein ID (required)
>   - `refseq`: amino acid sequence (used to inject sequence into PDB if missing)
>



## Running 3D clustering Analysis

For in depth information on how to obtain the required input data and for comprehensive information about the output, please refer to the [Input and Output Documentation](https://github.com/bbglab/oncodrive3d/tree/master/docs/run_input_output.md) of the 3D clustering analysis.  

### Input

- **Mutations file** (`required`): It can be either:
   - **<input_maf>**: A Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) file annotated with consequences (e.g., by using [Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html)).
   - **<input_vep>**: The unfiltered output of VEP including annotations for all possible transcripts.

- **<mut_profile>** (`optional`): Dictionary including the normalized frequencies of mutations (*values*) in every possible trinucleotide context (*keys*), such as 'ACA>A', 'ACC>A', and so on.

---

> [!NOTE] 
> Examples of the input files are available in the [Test Input Folder](https://github.com/bbglab/oncodrive3d/tree/master/test/input).  
Please refer to these examples to understand the expected format and structure of the input files.

---

---

> [!NOTE]
> Oncodrive3D uses the mutational profile of the cohort to build an accurate background model. However, it’s not strictly required. If the mutational profile is not provided, the tool will use a simple uniform distribution as the background model for simulating mutations and scoring potential 3D clusters.

---

### Main Output

- **Gene-level output**: CSV file (`\<cohort>.3d_clustering_genes.csv`) containing the results of the analysis at the gene level. Each row represents a gene, sorted from the most significant to the least significant based on the 3D clustering analysis. The table also includes genes that were not analyzed, with the reason for exclusion provided in the `status` column.
  
- **Residue-level output**: CSV file (`<cohort>.3d_clustering_pos.csv`) containing the results of the analysis at the level of mutated residues. Each row corresponds to a mutated position within a gene and includes detailed information for each potential mutational cluster.
