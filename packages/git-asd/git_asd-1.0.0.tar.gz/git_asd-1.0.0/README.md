# ASD

ASD is a natural language Git assistant for the terminal. It translates plain English instructions into Git commands, helping you manage branches, histories, and merges safely and efficiently.

## Why ASD?

I like building things and always wanted something focused on Git. With some free time, I built ASD to explore how natural language can simplify complex Git workflows.

## Features

- Translate English instructions into Git commands.
- Guide complex workflows with best-practice suggestions.
- Visualize commit graphs and branch histories.
- Offer safety checks and recovery guidance for risky operations.

## Getting Started

Install directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/adikuma/asd.git
```

Launch the CLI:

```bash
asd
```

This opens ASDâ€™s interactive terminal interface. Enter any Git task in plain English.

## Roadmap

ASD is an early project **with plenty of room for improvement**. I would love to have people test it, report issues, and suggest features so I can refine and expand its capabilities.

Contributions and feedback are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request.
