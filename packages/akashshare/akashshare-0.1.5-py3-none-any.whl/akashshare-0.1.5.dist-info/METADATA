# akashshare

A simple CLI tool to share files over LAN using UDP for discovery and TCP for file transfer.
Works on Mac, Linux, and Windows connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

---

## Quick Start (pipx preferred)

If you don’t have `pipx` installed, install it using:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

More info: [pipx installation guide](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)

Then run directly using:

```bash
pipx run git+https://github.com/yourusername/akashshare.git
```

Great for quick file sharing on the same Wi-Fi network without installing.

## Features

* Discover peers on the local network using UDP broadcast
* Transfer files over TCP connection
* Easy interactive CLI for sending and receiving files
* No heavy dependencies, lightweight and fast
* Cross-platform (Mac, Linux, Windows)

---

## Installation (alternate method)

### Install via pip

```bash
pip install akashshare
```

Run the tool by:

```bash
akashshare
```

---

## Usage

Run the CLI and choose an action:

* **Send**: Choose a file to share; receiver will be discovered automatically.
* **Receive**: Listen for a sender and receive files.
* **Exit**: Quit the tool.

---

## How it works

* **Discovery**: Uses UDP broadcast on port `50000` to find peers on the local network.
* **File transfer**: Uses TCP on port `50001` to send or receive the file.

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher
* InquirerPy (installed automatically via pip)

---

## Example

On **sender** machine:

```bash
akashshare
# Select "Send" and enter file path when prompted
```

On **receiver** machine:

```bash
akashshare
# Select "Receive" to wait for incoming files
```
