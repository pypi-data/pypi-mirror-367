## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Setting Up Your Environment
To contribute, set up a local development environment:
1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed, as specified in `pyproject.toml`.
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gerivanc/entropy-password-generator.git
   cd entropy-password-generator
   ```
3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   **On Windows**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv entropy_venv
   .\entropy_venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
4. **Install development tools** (optional, but recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install flake8 black isort
   ```
   These tools help ensure code quality:
   - `flake8`: Linting to enforce PEP 8.
   - `black`: Automatic code formatting.
   - `isort`: Sorting imports.

### üì¢ 2. Reporting Issues
If you find a bug, have a feature request, or notice documentation that needs improvement:
- **Search existing issues**: Check the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/gerivanc/entropy-password-generator/issues) to avoid duplicates.
- **Use templates**: Follow the issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for bug reports or feature requests.
- **Provide details**: Include a clear title, description, steps to reproduce (if applicable), expected behavior, and screenshots or logs.
- **Security issues**: For vulnerabilities, follow the process in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/gerivanc/entropy-password-generator/blob/main/SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue.

### üîÑ 3. Submitting Pull Requests
To contribute code, documentation, or other changes, submit a pull request (PR):
1. **Fork the repository**:
   - Click the "Fork" button on the [repository page](https://github.com/gerivanc/entropy-password-generator).
   - Clone your fork:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/gerivanc/entropy-password-generator.git
     cd entropy-password-generator
     ```
2. **Create a branch**:
   - Use a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-new-mode`, `fix/bug-entropy-calc`):
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```
3. **Make changes**:
   - Follow the coding standards below.
   - Test changes locally (see "Testing" section).
   - Update documentation (e.g., `README.md`, docstrings) if necessary.
   - Run linting and formatting tools:
     ```bash
     flake8 entropy_password_generator/
     black entropy_password_generator/
     isort entropy_password_generator/
     ```
4. **Commit changes**:
   - Use clear, concise commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (e.g., `feat: add new password mode`, `fix: correct entropy calculation`):
     ```bash
     git commit -m "feat: describe your change"
     ```
5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Open a pull request**:
   - Go to the [repository](https://github.com/gerivanc/entropy-password-generator) and click "New pull request".
   - Select your branch and provide a detailed description of your changes.
   - Reference related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").
   - Ensure your PR passes the GitHub Actions CI checks (if configured).

### üìú 4. Coding Standards
To maintain consistency and security, adhere to these guidelines:
- **Python Version**: Use Python 3.8 or higher, as specified in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Style**: Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code style. Use `flake8` for linting and `black` for formatting.
- **Docstrings**: Write clear, English docstrings in [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for all functions and modules.
- **Security**: Use the `secrets` module for cryptographic randomness. Avoid insecure libraries like `random`. If introducing new dependencies, justify their necessity and security.
- **File Structure**: Keep changes within the existing structure (e.g., core logic in `entropy_password_generator/password_generator.py`).
- **Licensing**: By contributing, you agree that your contributions are licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/gerivanc/entropy-password-generator/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

### üß™ 5. Testing
Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality:
- **Manual Testing**:
  - Run the CLI with different modes and configurations:
    ```bash
    python3 entropy_password_generator/password_generator.py --mode 1
    python3 entropy_password_generator/password_generator.py --length 15 --no-special
    ```
  - If the package is installed (e.g., from Test PyPI):
    ```bash
    entropy-password-generator --mode 1
    ```
  - Note: Use the direct path (`python3 entropy_password_generator/password_generator.py`) or CLI command (`entropy-password-generator`) to avoid `RuntimeWarning` issues with `python -m`.
- **Cross-Version Testing**:
  - Test with Python 3.8, 3.10, and 3.12 to ensure compatibility. Use tools like `tox` or a GitHub Actions matrix if available.
- **Automated Tests**:
  - Currently, the project does not include automated tests. If adding tests, use `pytest` and place them in a `tests/` directory. Example:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    pytest tests/
    ```
  - Contributions that add test coverage are highly encouraged.
- **Validation**:
  - Verify that new modes or configurations align with the `MODES` dictionary in `password_generator.py`.
  - Check that entropy calculations remain accurate and compliant with Proton¬© (75+ bits) and NIST standards.
