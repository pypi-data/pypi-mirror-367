## 🧪 Test PyPI Usage

The Test PyPI release of EntroPy Password Generator is intended for testing and development purposes only. It may contain experimental features or unpatched vulnerabilities and should not be used in production environments. For production use, install the stable version from the official [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/entropy-password-generator/).

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

To ensure the secure use of EntroPy Password Generator:
- Use Python 3.8 or higher, keeping it updated to the latest patch version.
- Install the tool in a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
- Verify package integrity during installation by checking the package's hash or signature (available on the [PyPI project page](https://pypi.org/project/entropy-password-generator/)).
- Store generated passwords securely using a trusted password manager, such as [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).
