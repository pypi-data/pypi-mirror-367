**EntroPy Password Generator** is a secure and customizable password generator developed in Python, enabling users to generate strong passwords on both Linux and Windows systems. It creates robust passwords with configurable character sets and calculates their entropy to evaluate strength. The project provides 20+ modes for secure password generation, ranging from 15 to 128 characters, with entropies between 97.62 bits and 833.00 bits, exceeding the [Proton©](https://proton.me/blog/what-is-password-entropy) recommended minimum of 75 bits and the cryptographic strength best practices outlined in [NIST SP 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) and [NIST SP 800-132](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-132.pdf).

# 📜 Disclaimer
Do not attempt to memorize the passwords generated by this tool. Instead, use a reliable password manager, such as [Bitwarden©](https://bitwarden.com/), which I personally recommend. The only password you should memorize is the master password for your password manager's vault, created with a strong combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible to enhance security. A great option for managing your 2FA is Ente Auth , a free, open-source, and cross-platform app that provides end-to-end encrypted backups. [Ente Auth](https://ente.io/auth/) ensures your 2FA codes are secure and synced across devices, with externally audited encryption, offering robust protection for all your accounts that support 2FA.

# ✨ Features
- Generates passwords with lengths between **15 and 128 characters**.
- Supports uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), and special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?~\\).
- Option to exclude visually ambiguous characters (e.g., 'I', 'L', 'O', '0') for better readability.
- Calculates password entropy (in bits) to evaluate strength.
- Displays a warning if the generated password's entropy is below 75 bits (Proton© standard), with suggestions to improve security.
- Command-line interface (CLI) for flexible usage.
- Uses Python's `secrets` module for cryptographically secure random generation.

---

# 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- No external dependencies (uses only standard Python libraries: `secrets`, `string`, `math`, `argparse`).

---

# 🔒 Password Modes
The generator offers 20+ modes for secure password generation, divided into three blocks:

- **Block I (Modes 1–10):** Fixed length of 24 characters, including ambiguous characters (e.g., 'I', 'O', '0'), with varying character sets to balance readability and security. Ideal for general-purpose passwords, such as website logins or application credentials.
- **Block II (Modes 11–20):** Varying lengths (15 to 128 characters), mostly excluding ambiguous characters for enhanced readability. These modes cater to sensitive applications, from personal accounts to cryptographic keys and enterprise-grade security.
- **Block III (Using Custom Configuration):** Custom passwords with lengths between 15 and 128 characters, specified using the --length option followed by the desired length (15-128), including ambiguous characters. 
These passwords achieve entropies ranging from 97.62 to 833.00 bits, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, from personal use to high-security environments requiring robust cryptographic strength.

## Password Modes Summary
The table below summarizes the 20 password generation modes, ordered by increasing entropy, highlighting their configurations, character set sizes (\( R \)), and recommended use cases:

| Mode | Length | Character Set | R (Charset Size) | Entropy (bits) | Security Level | Use Case |
|------|--------|---------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| 11 | 15 | Full (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols, no ambiguous) | 95 | 95.10 | Strong | Personal accounts (email, social media) |
| 13 | 20 | Lowercase + Digits (no ambiguous) | 36 | 99.08 | Strong | Basic application logins |
| 14 | 20 | Uppercase + Digits (no ambiguous) | 36 | 99.08 | Strong | Device authentication |
| 12 | 18 | Full (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols, with ambiguous) | 95 | 117.14 | Very Strong | Professional accounts (work email, VPN) |
| 4 | 24 | Uppercase + Digits (with ambiguous) | 36 | 124.08 | Very Strong | Legacy systems requiring uppercase |
| 5 | 24 | Lowercase + Digits (with ambiguous) | 36 | 124.08 | Very Strong | Readable passwords for manual entry |
| 6 | 24 | Digits + Special (with ambiguous) | 43 | 126.85 | Very Strong | API tokens with limited character sets |
| 3 | 24 | Uppercase + Lowercase (with ambiguous) | 52 | 136.81 | Very Strong | General-purpose website logins |
| 1 | 24 | Lowercase + Special (with ambiguous) | 59 | 138.75 | Very Strong | Secure notes or backup codes |
| 2 | 24 | Uppercase + Special (with ambiguous) | 59 | 138.75 | Very Strong | Administrative console access |
| 7 | 24 | Uppercase + Lowercase + Digits (with ambiguous) | 62 | 142.90 | Very Strong | Multi-user system credentials |
| 9 | 24 | Uppercase + Digits + Special (with ambiguous) | 69 | 144.54 | Very Strong | Database access keys |
| 10 | 24 | Lowercase + Digits + Special (with ambiguous) | 69 | 144.54 | Very Strong | Secure file encryption |
| 8 | 24 | Uppercase + Lowercase + Special (with ambiguous) | 85 | 151.16 | Extremely Strong | High-security application logins |
| 15 | 24 | Full (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols, no ambiguous) | 94 | 152.16 | Extremely Strong | Enterprise-grade passwords |
| 16 | 32 | Full (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols, no ambiguous) | 94 | 202.88 | Cryptographic Grade | API keys for sensitive services |
| 17 | 42 | Full (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols, no ambiguous) | 94 | 266.27 | Cryptographic Grade | Server authentication tokens |
| 18 | 60 | Full (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols, no ambiguous) | 94 | 380.39 | Ultra Secure | Financial system credentials |
| 19 | 75 | Full (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols, no ambiguous) | 94 | 475.49 | Ultra Secure | Master keys for password managers |
| 20 | 128 | Full (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols, no ambiguous) | 94 | 811.50 | Ultra Secure (Theoretical Maximum) | Cryptographic keys, blockchain wallets |

> **Note**: **Search Space Depth** defines the variety of characters in a password, influencing its resistance to brute-force attacks. Expanding it with letters, numbers, and symbols increases possible combinations, making the password harder to crack. **Entropy** reaches theoretical maximum values under uniform random selection, but requiring at least one character per type slightly reduces effective entropy in shorter passwords. This reduction is negligible, and all modes exceed Proton© and NIST standards.

# 📊 Password Entropy Calculation

> **Secure by Design**  
> With Python's `secrets` module, the EntroPy Password Generator ensures cryptographically secure randomization, delivering passwords that exceed Proton© (75 bits) and NIST (80+ bits) entropy standards.

The generator calculates password entropy using the formula: \( E(R) = \log_2(R^L) \), where:
- \( R \): Size of the character set.
- \( L \): Password length.
- \( E(R) \): Entropy in bits (higher is stronger).

**All 20 modes produce passwords with entropies from 95.70 to 830.98 bits**, surpassing Proton© (75 bits) and NIST (80+ bits) standards. For example:
- Mode 11 (15 chars, full no ambiguous, \( R=90 \)): \( \log_2(90) \times 15 \approx 95.70 \) bits.
- Mode 20 (128 chars, full no ambiguous, \( R=90 \)): \( \log_2(90) \times 128 \approx 830.98 \) bits.

**Using custom configuration, modes produce passwords with entropies from 97.62 to 833.00 bits**, surpassing Proton© (75 bits) and NIST (80+ bits) standards. For example:
- Using `--length 15 --with-ambiguous` (15 chars, all types, with ambiguous, ( R=90 )): ( \log_2(90) \times 15 \approx 97.62 ) bits.
- Using `--length 128 --with-ambiguous` (128 chars, all types, with ambiguous, ( R=90 )): ( \log_2(90) \times 128 \approx 833.00 ) bits.

> **Note**: Entropy values assume ideal randomness, achieved via the `secrets` module. The requirement of at least one character per selected type slightly reduces effective entropy for shorter passwords, but all modes remain compliant with security standards.
