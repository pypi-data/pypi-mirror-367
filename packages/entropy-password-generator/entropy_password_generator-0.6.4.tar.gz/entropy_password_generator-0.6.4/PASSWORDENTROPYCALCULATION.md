## 🔍 Overview 

The **EntroPy Password Generator** creates passwords with high entropy to maximize resistance against brute-force attacks. Entropy measures password strength, indicating the computational effort required to guess a password. All 20 generation modes produce passwords exceeding the Proton© (75 bits) and NIST (80+ bits) recommendations, ensuring robust security for applications ranging from personal accounts to cryptographic keys.

## 📊 How Entropy is Calculated 

The generator uses the standard entropy formula:

\[ E(R) = \log_2(R^L) \]

where:
- **R**: Number of possible characters (character set size).
- **L**: Password length.
- **E(R)**: Entropy in bits.

Simplified:
- Entropy = \(\log_2(\text{charset size}) \times \text{password length}\)
- Higher entropy means exponentially greater effort to crack the password.

> **Note**: Entropy values are theoretical maximums, assuming uniform random selection via Python's `secrets` module. The requirement of at least one character per selected type (e.g., uppercase, lowercase) slightly reduces effective entropy for shorter passwords (e.g., 15 characters). This reduction is negligible for the lengths used (15–128 characters), and all modes exceed Proton© and NIST standards.

To validate entropy locally, run a mode and check the output:
```bash
python3 entropy_password_generator/password_generator.py --mode 1
```

## 🔒 Security Benchmarks 

| Source | Minimum Recommended Entropy | Context |
|:------|:-----------------------------|:--------|
| **Proton©** | 75 bits | General password strength ([source](https://proton.me/blog/what-is-password-entropy)) |
| **NIST (SP 800-63B)** | 80+ bits | Passwords protecting sensitive data ([source](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)) |

> **Note**: For highly sensitive accounts (e.g., financial, administrative), aim for **100+ bits** of entropy.

## 🚀 Project Capabilities 

### Password Generation Modes
The generator offers 20+ modes for secure password generation, divided into three blocks:

- **Block I (Modes 1–10)**: Fixed length (24 characters), includes ambiguous characters (e.g., `I`, `l`, `O`, `0`), balancing readability and security. Ideal for general-purpose passwords.
- **Block II (Modes 11–20)**: Varying lengths (15–128 characters), mostly excluding ambiguous characters (`I`, `l`, `O`, `0`, `1`, `` ` ``). Suitable for sensitive applications.
- **Block III (Using Custom Configuration)**: Lengths from 15–128 characters, with or without ambiguous characters, using `--length` and `--with-ambiguous`.

The table below details each mode, with character set sizes (\( R \)), entropy, and use cases. Ambiguous characters are excluded unless specified.

**Notes**:
- Full character set (no ambiguous): 26 uppercase + 26 lowercase + 10 digits + 32 symbols = 94 characters.
- Ambiguous characters: `I`, `l`, `O`, `0`, `1`, `` ` ``.

## 🛡️ Why High Entropy Matters 
- **< 50 bits**: Vulnerable, crackable in seconds.
- **50–75 bits**: Moderately secure, risky for high-value targets.
- **75–100 bits**: Strong, suitable for personal and professional use.
- **> 100 bits**: Very strong, ideal for sensitive applications.

High entropy mitigates:
- Brute-force attacks (online/offline).
- Credential stuffing.
- Rainbow table attacks (with salting).
