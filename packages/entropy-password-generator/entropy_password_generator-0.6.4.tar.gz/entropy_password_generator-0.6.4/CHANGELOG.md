## [0.4.0] - 2025-04-27

### Added
- Deep update to the code structure.
- Added version number (0.4.0) to the authorship comment and output header.
- Added `PASSWORDENTROPYCALCULATION.md` document with detailed entropy calculation explanation, benchmarks, and security recommendations.
- Added authorship comment with project information at the beginning of `password_generator.py`.
- Added header with project information (Copyright, Author, GitHub, License, Changelog) in the output of generated passwords.

### Changed
- Updated PyPI publish workflow (`pypi-publish.yml`) to use `actions/checkout@v3` instead of `v4` to resolve persistent checkout error.
- Updated PyPI publish workflow (`pypi-publish.yml`) to fix checkout error by adding event context debugging and `actions:read` permission.
- Updated PyPI publish workflow (`pypi-publish.yml`) with debugging steps to verify Python version, build output, and artifact downloads.
- Updated CI workflow (`python-app.yml`) to use `python -m` for script execution and added debug step to verify working directory.
- Updated CI workflow (`python-app.yml`) to fix script execution by invoking the script directly instead of using `python -m`.
- Refactored `password_generator.py` to fix flake8 linting errors (line length, complexity, spacing).
- Updated minimum Python requirement to 3.8 in `README.md` and `pyproject.toml` due to Python 3.6 deprecation.
- Updated CI workflow (`python-app.yml`) to test with Python 3.8, 3.10, and 3.12, removing Python 3.6.
- Adjusted CLI usage commands in `README.md` to use the package structure (`python -m entropy_password_generator.password_generator`).
- Restructured project as a Python package for PyPI publication, including `pyproject.toml` and package directory.
- Added PyPI publish workflow (`.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml`) to automatically publish releases.
- Added CI workflow (`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`) for linting and basic script execution across multiple Python versions.
- Adjusted the About section on the project page to fit the 350-character limit while maintaining key details.
- Enhanced the About section on the project page with a more detailed and compelling description of features and benefits.
- Updated entropy values in `README.md` to align with `PASSWORDENTROPYCALCULATION.md` (95.70 bits to 816.64 bits).
- Adjusted link to `PASSWORDENTROPYCALCULATION.md` in `README.md` for clarity.
- Reordered Project Capabilities table in `README.md` by increasing entropy (bits) for better clarity.
- Updated Project Capabilities table in `README.md` with recalculated entropy values for all 20 password generation modes.
- Adjusted separators in the authorship comment for better readability.
