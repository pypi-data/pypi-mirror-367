# Kubelingo Project Roadmap

This document outlines the vision, features, and enhancements planned for the Kubelingo CLI quiz tool. It is organized into key focus areas and milestone ideas.

> _This roadmap is a living document. Feel free to propose additions or reprioritize items via issues or pull requests._

## Phase 0: Current Implementation

### Existing Features to Maintain
- [x] **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API integration for detailed explanations (`kubelingo/utils/llm_integration.py`)
- [x] **Review/Flagging System**: Mark questions for later review (`mark_question_for_review`, `unmark_question_for_review`)
- [x] **Rust-Python Bridge**: Performance-critical validation functions in Rust (`kubelingo_core` module)
- [x] **Session History**: Basic session logging and history tracking
- [x] **Semantic YAML Validation**: Compare parsed YAML structures, not raw text
- [x] **Category Filtering**: Filter questions by Kubernetes topic areas
- [x] **Randomized Question Order**: Prevent memorization of question sequences
- [x] **Multiple Question Types**: Command-based and YAML editing exercises

### Technical Infrastructure
- [x] **Hybrid Architecture**: Python CLI with Rust performance modules
- [x] **Maturin Build System**: Python package with Rust extensions
- [x] **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with multi-Python version testing
- [x] **Modular Design**: Separate modules for different quiz types

## Phase 1: Core Enhancements

Focus on solidifying the core quiz experience and adding high-value features.

### Bug Fixes & Stability
- [x] **Fix Command Validation**: `k get sa` should be equivalent to `kubectl get sa` - RESOLVED ✅
- [x] **Fix YAML Validation API**: Update validation function calls to use new dictionary format - RESOLVED ✅
- [x] **Fix Import Errors**: Resolve `kubelingo_core` import issues in tests - RESOLVED ✅
- [x] **Fix Vim Editor Integration**: Handle KeyboardInterrupt and validation errors properly - RESOLVED ✅

### Difficulty Levels
- [ ] Implement a mechanism to tag questions with difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). [#1]
- [ ] Add a command-line flag (`--difficulty`) to let users filter questions. [#2]
- [ ] Adjust scoring or hints based on the selected difficulty. [#3]

### Performance Tracking & History
- [ ] Enhance history tracking to include time taken per question and streaks. [#4]
- [ ] Implement a `kubelingo history` command to show detailed performance analytics. [#5]
- [ ] Visualize progress over time (e.g., ASCII charts in the terminal). [#6]

### Spaced Repetition System (SRS)
- [ ] Integrate an SRS algorithm to prioritize questions the user has previously answered incorrectly. [#7]
- [ ] Automatically schedule questions for review based on performance. [#8]

## Phase 2: Interactive Environments

Bridge the gap between theory and practice by integrating with live Kubernetes clusters.

### Sandbox Integration
- [ ] Finalize integration with a sandbox provider (e.g., a custom Go-based sandbox environment). [#9]
- [ ] Develop a session manager to request, configure, and tear down ephemeral Kubernetes environments for quiz sessions. [#10]
- [ ] Ensure `kubectl` commands are correctly routed to the sandbox cluster. [#11]

### Homelab Integration
- [ ] Add functionality to allow users to use their own homelab cluster. [#12]
- [ ] Implement a configuration flow (`kubelingo config --use-context <my-homelab-context>`) to point KubeLingo to a user-provided kubeconfig context. [#13]
- [ ] Add safety checks and warnings when operating on a non-ephemeral cluster. [#14]

### Command Validation in Live Environments
- [ ] Develop a robust system to capture commands run by the user within the live environment. [#15]
- [ ] Validate the *state* of the cluster after a user's command, rather than just comparing command strings. (e.g., "Was a pod named 'nginx' actually created?"). [#16]

## Phase 3: Advanced Editing and Content

Improve the YAML editing experience and expand the question library.

### CKAD-Level Vim Integration
_Status: Planned. See [Vim Integration Analysis](vim_integration_analysis.md) for details._

#### Foundation
- [ ] **Enhanced Vim Editor**: Extend `VimYamlEditor` with efficiency tracking and command recording. [#55]
- [ ] **Vim Command Trainer**: Create a dedicated module for practicing Vim commands, modal editing, and efficiency patterns. `pyvim` has been integrated as an optional editor. [#56]

#### Realistic Scenarios
- [ ] **CKAD Scenario Engine**: Develop an engine to generate realistic exam scenarios (pods, deployments, troubleshooting). [#57]
- [ ] **`kubectl edit` Simulation**: Implement a workflow to simulate `kubectl edit` and `dry-run` patterns. [#58]

#### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Performance Analytics**: Build a system to analyze Vim usage, generate efficiency reports, and track progress. [#59]
- [ ] **Adaptive Difficulty**: Implement logic to adjust exercise difficulty and time limits based on user performance. [#60]

#### Integration and Polish
- [ ] **Comprehensive Vim Testing**: Add integration tests using a real Vim process and a Vim automation framework. [#61]
- [ ] **Documentation and Guides**: Create Vim quick-reference guides and training materials for CKAD-specific techniques. [#62]

### Real-time YAML Validation
- [ ] Integrate a YAML linter (e.g., `yamllint`) and the Kubernetes OpenAPI schema. [#19]
- [ ] Provide immediate feedback on syntax errors and invalid Kubernetes resource definitions as the user types. [#20]

### Expanded Content & New Question Types
- [ ] Add question packs for CKA and CKS certification topics. [#21]
- [ ] Introduce troubleshooting scenarios where the user must diagnose and fix a broken resource in a live environment. [#22]
- [ ] Add questions about Kubernetes security best practices. [#23]

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### Enhanced Learning Analytics
- [ ] **Detailed Performance Metrics**: Time per question, accuracy trends, weak topic identification [#24]
- [ ] **Learning Curve Analysis**: Track improvement over time with statistical analysis [#25]
- [ ] **Adaptive Difficulty**: Automatically adjust question difficulty based on performance [#26]
- [ ] **Competency Mapping**: Map performance to specific CKAD exam objectives [#27]

### Development Workflow
 - [ ] **Hot Reload for Development**: Automatically reload question data during development [#28]
 - [ ] **Question Authoring Tools**: CLI tools for creating and validating new questions [#29]
 - [ ] **Bulk Question Import**: Import questions from various formats (CSV, JSON, YAML) [#30]
 - [ ] **Question Analytics**: Track which questions are most/least effective [#31]
 - [ ] **Persistent AI Question Database**: Store AI-generated questions in a local SQLite database for reuse, auditing, and analytics [#65]

### Advanced Validation
- [ ] **Multi-Solution Support**: Accept multiple correct answers for open-ended questions [#36]
- [ ] **Partial Credit Scoring**: Grade partially correct YAML with detailed feedback [#37]
- [ ] **Context-Aware Validation**: Validate based on cluster state, not just manifest content [#38]
- [ ] **Security Scanning**: Integrate with tools like Falco for security best practices [#39]

## Phase 5: Ecosystem Integration

- [ ] Experiment with AI-generated questions for a virtually unlimited question pool. [#53]

### Multiplayer Mode
- [ ] A competitive mode where two or more users race to answer questions correctly. [#54]
