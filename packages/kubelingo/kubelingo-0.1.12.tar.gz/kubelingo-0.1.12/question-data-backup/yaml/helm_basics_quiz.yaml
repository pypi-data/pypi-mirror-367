    prompt: "How can you uninstall a Helm release named `my-release`?"
    response: "helm uninstall my-release"

    prompt: "How do you upgrade an existing Helm release named `my-release` using the chart in `./my-chart`?"
    response: "helm upgrade my-release ./my-chart"
    explanation: |
      The correct command is `helm upgrade my-release ./my-chart`. An answer like `helm release upgrade` is incomplete and uses incorrect syntax. The `upgrade` command requires the release name and the path to the chart.

    prompt: "Assuming the `bitnami` repository has been added, how do you install the `bitnami/node` chart as a release named `my-node`, setting the `replicaCount` value to 5?"
    response: "helm install my-node bitnami/node --set replicaCount=5"
    explanation: |
      You can override values in a chart's `values.yaml` file at installation time using the `--set` flag. First, find the relevant key (e.g., with `helm show values bitnami/node | grep -i replica`). Then, install the chart with the override: `helm install my-node bitnami/node --set replicaCount=5`.
