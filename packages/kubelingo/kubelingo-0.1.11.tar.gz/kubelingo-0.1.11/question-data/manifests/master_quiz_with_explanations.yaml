In Namespace jupiter you'll find an apache Deployment (with one replica) named jupiter-crew-deploy and a ClusterIP Service called jupiter-crew-svc which exposes it. Change this service to a NodePort one to make it available on all nodes on port 30100.

Last lunch you told your coworker from department Mars Inc how amazing InitContainers are. Now he would like to see one in action. There is a Deployment yaml at /opt/course/17/test-init-container.yaml. This Deployment spins up a single Pod of image nginx:1.17.3-alpine and serves files from a mounted volume, which is empty right now.
Create an InitContainer named init-con which also mounts that volume and creates a file index.html with content check this out! in the root of the mounted volume. For this test we ignore that it doesn't contain valid html.
The InitContainer should be using image busybox:1.31.0. Test your implementation for example using curl from a temporary nginx:alpine Pod."

In Namespace venus you'll find two Deployments named api and frontend. Both Deployments are exposed inside the cluster using Services. Create a NetworkPolicy named np1 which restricts outgoing tcp connections from Deployment frontend and only allows those going to Deployment api. Make sure the NetworkPolicy still allows outgoing traffic on UDP/TCP ports 53 for DNS resolution.
Test using: wget www.google.com and wget api:2222 from a Pod of Deployment frontend."

Team Mercury asked you to perform some operations using Helm, all in Namespace mercury:
Delete release internal-issue-report-apiv1
Upgrade release internal-issue-report-apiv2 to any newer version of chart bitnami/nginx available
Install a new release internal-issue-report-apache of chart bitnami/apache. The Deployment should have two replicas, set these via Helm-values during install
There seems to be a broken release, stuck in pending-install state. Find it and delete it"

The Tech Lead of Mercury2D decided it's time for more logging, to finally fight all these missing data incidents. There is an existing container named cleaner-con in Deployment cleaner in Namespace mercury. This container mounts a volume and writes logs into a file called cleaner.log.
The yaml for the existing Deployment is available at /opt/course/16/cleaner.yaml. Persist your changes at /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml on ckad7326 but also make sure the Deployment is running.
Create a sidecar container named logger-con, image busybox:1.31.0 , which mounts the same volume and writes the content of cleaner.log to stdout, you can use the tail -f command for this. This way it can be picked up by kubectl logs.
Check if the logs of the new container reveal something about the missing data incidents."

The board of Team Neptune decided to take over control of one e-commerce webserver from Team Saturn. The administrator who once setup this webserver is not part of the organisation any longer. All information you could get was that the e-commerce system is called my-happy-shop.
Search for the correct Pod in Namespace saturn and move it to Namespace neptune. It doesn't matter if you shut it down and spin it up again, it probably hasn't any customers anyways."

In Namespace pluto there is single Pod named holy-api. It has been working okay for a while now but Team Pluto needs it to be more reliable.
Convert the Pod into a Deployment named holy-api with 3 replicas and delete the single Pod once done. The raw Pod template file is available at /opt/course/9/holy-api-pod.yaml.

Team Moonpie, which has the Namespace moon, needs more storage. Create a new PersistentVolumeClaim named moon-pvc-126 in that namespace. This claim should use a new StorageClass moon-retain with the provisioner set to moon-retainer and the reclaimPolicy set to Retain. The claim should request storage of 3Gi, an accessMode of ReadWriteOnce and should use the new StorageClass.
The provisioner moon-retainer will be created by another team, so it's expected that the PVC will not boot yet. Confirm this by writing the event message from the PVC into file /opt/course/13/pvc-126-reason on ckad9043."

There are files to build a container image located at /opt/course/11/image on ckad9043. The container will run a Golang application which outputs information to stdout. You're asked to perform the following tasks:
ℹ️ Run all Docker and Podman commands as user root. Use sudo docker and sudo podman or become root with sudo -i
Change the Dockerfile: set ENV variable SUN_CIPHER_ID to hardcoded value 5b9c1065-e39d-4a43-a04a-e59bcea3e03f

Build the image using sudo podman, tag it registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman and push it to the registry
Run a container using sudo podman, which keeps running detached in the background, named sun-cipher using image registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman
