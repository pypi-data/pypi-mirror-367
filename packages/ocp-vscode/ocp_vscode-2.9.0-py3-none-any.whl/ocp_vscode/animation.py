        Adding a three.js animation track.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : string
            The path (or id) of the cad object for which this track is meant.
            Usually of the form `/top-level/level2/...`
        action : {"t", "tx", "ty", "tz", "q", "rx", "ry", "rz"}
            The action type:

            - "tx", "ty", "tz" for translations along the x, y or z-axis
            - "t" to add a position vector (3-dim array) to the current position of the CAD object
            - "rx", "ry", "rz" for rotations around x, y or z-axis
            - "q" to apply a quaternion to the location of the CAD object
        times : list of float or int
            An array of floats describing the points in time where CAD object (with id `path`) should be at the location
            defined by `action` and `values`
        values : list of float or int
            An array of same length as `times` defining the locations where the CAD objects should be according to the
            `action` provided. Formats:

            - "tx", "ty", "tz": float distance to move
            - "t": 3-dim tuples or lists defining the positions to move to
            - "rx", "ry", "rz": float angle in degrees
            - "q" quaternions of the form (x,y,z,w) the represent the rotation to be applied
