Examples:

  1. Runs the release procedure for all packages listed in ``changelog.md``:

     .. code:: sh

        devtool gitlab release -vv changelog.md

     .. tip::

        In case of errors, just edit the changelog file to remove packages
        already released before relaunching the application.

  2. The option ``--dry-run`` can be used to let the script print what it would
     do instead of actually doing it:

     .. code:: sh

        devtool gitlab release -vv --dry-run changelog.md

    help="Only goes through the actions, but does not execute them "
    "(combine with the verbosity flags - e.g. ``-vvv``) to enable "
    "printing to help you understand what will be done",

    """Tags packages on GitLab from an input CHANGELOG in markdown format.

    By using a CHANGELOG file as an input (e.g. that can be generated with the
    ``changelog`` command), this script goes through all packages listed (and
    in order):

        * Modifies ``pyproject.toml`` with the new release number
        * Sets-up the README links to point to the correct pipeline and
          documentation for the package
        * Commits, tags and pushes the git project adding the changelog
          description for the GitLab release page
        * Waits for the pipeline launched by the previous step to end
        * Bumps the package version again, to the next beta patch
        * Re-modifies the README to point to the "latest" documentation and
          pipeline versions
        * Re-commits and pushes the whole with the option ``[ci skip]``.

    The changelog is expected to have the following structure:

    .. code:: markdown

       # group-name/package-name: ``major``|``minor``|``patch``

         Description of changes in group-name/package-name

       # group-name/package-name-2: ``major``|``minor``|``patch``

         Description of changes in group-name/package-name-2

    The headings, each, correspond to package names, followed by a colon
    (``:``), and then one of the following keywords: ``major``, ``minor``, or
    ``patch``, indicating which part of the version number will be bumped
    during the release procedure (N.B.: following semantic version numbering).

    An indented piece of text marks the release notes for the package to be
    tagged, in any amount of detail.  The description of a single package is
    suffixed by another package heading, or the end of the file.

    You may use `GitLab-flavoured markdown (GLFM)
    <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html>`_ to refer to closed issues
    or merge requests.  Alternatively, use the command ``changelog`` to
    auto-generate the description for your release.
