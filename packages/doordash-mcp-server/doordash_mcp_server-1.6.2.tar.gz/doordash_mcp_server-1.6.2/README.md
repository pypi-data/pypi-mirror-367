## Installation

### Option 1: Install from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/doordash-automation/doordash-mcp.git
cd doordash-mcp

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the MCP server
pip install -e .
```

### Option 2: Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install doordash-mcp
```

## Configuration

### 1. Set up your DoorDash Organization ID

You must obtain a valid DoorDash organization ID for API access. This is required and the server will not function without it.

Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export DOORDASH_ORG_ID="your-org-id-here"
```

**Note**: Replace `your-org-id-here` with your actual DoorDash organization ID.

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Add the DoorDash MCP server to your Claude Desktop configuration.

**On macOS:**
Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**On Windows:**
Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "doordash": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "doordash_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DOORDASH_ORG_ID": "your-org-id-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or if you installed from source:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "doordash": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/doordash-mcp/doordash_mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "DOORDASH_ORG_ID": "your-org-id-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

After updating the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.
