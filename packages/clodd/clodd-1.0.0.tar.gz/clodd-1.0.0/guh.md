 Based on my analysis of the WebSocket server and client code, here are the potential reasons why the
  websocket server & client may not be working:

  Server-Side Issues (certainty: 85%)

  1. Directory Path Issues - streaming.py:136-143: The server defaults to watching ~/.claude/projects but
  only logs a warning if it doesn't exist. If this directory is missing or empty, no file watching occurs.
  2. File Watching Race Condition - streaming.py:71: Using asyncio.create_task() in the file handler without
   proper async context management could cause issues.
  3. File Position Tracking - streaming.py:146-150: File positions are initialized to file size, meaning
  only new content after server start is streamed. If files are being written to before the server starts,
  that content won't be broadcast.
  4. Error Handling in File Processing - streaming.py:87-92: JSON parsing errors are only logged as warnings
   but processing continues, potentially causing missed entries.

  Client-Side Issues (certainty: 75%)

  1. Connection Error Handling - streaming_client.py:51-53: The client only checks for ConnectionRefused but
   other connection issues might not be handled properly.
  2. Message Processing - streaming_client.py:44-49: JSON decode errors are caught but don't provide much
  debugging info about what was received.
  3. Timestamp Parsing - streaming_client.py:70-75: The timestamp parsing tries to handle ISO format but may
   fail silently on different timestamp formats.

  Common Integration Issues (certainty: 90%)

  1. Log File Location - The server watches ~/.claude/projects but Claude Code logs might be in a different
  location or structure than expected.
  2. JSONL Format Assumptions - streaming.py:68: Only watches .jsonl files, but Claude Code might use
  different extensions.
  3. Pydantic Model Compatibility - The ClaudeLogEntry model in models/claude_log.py may not match the
  actual format of Claude Code logs, causing parsing failures.
  4. Event Loop Context - The file watcher runs in a different thread than the WebSocket server, which could
   cause async context issues.

  Debugging Recommendations (certainty: 95%)

  1. Check if ~/.claude/projects exists and contains .jsonl files
  2. Run the server with --debug flag to see detailed logging
  3. Verify the actual format of Claude Code log entries matches the Pydantic models
  4. Test if file watching is working by manually creating/modifying test .jsonl files
  5. Check if the WebSocket port (8765) is available and not blocked by firewall

  The most likely issues are path/directory problems and model format mismatches between expected and actual
   Claude Code log formats.
