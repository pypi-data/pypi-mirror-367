## Abstract

We introduce the **Robust Audio Watermarking Benchmark (RAW-Bench)**, a benchmark for evaluating deep learning-based audio watermarking methods with standardized and systematic comparisons. To simulate real-world usage, we introduce a comprehensive audio attack pipeline with various distortions such as compression, background noise, and reverberation, along with a diverse test dataset including speech, environmental sounds, and music recordings. Evaluating four existing watermarking methods on RAW-Bench reveals two main insights: (i) neural compression techniques pose the most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such compressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases. Furthermore, we find that specific distortions, such as polarity inversion, time stretching, or reverb, seriously affect certain methods.
