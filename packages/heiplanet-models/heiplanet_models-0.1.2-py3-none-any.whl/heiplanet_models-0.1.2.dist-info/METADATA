# heiplanet-models 

## Description
This repository consists of a collection of models that share the same infrastructure code, used for the [heiplanet project](http://129.206.4.157/). 


## Installation 
## For usage
It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to install packages into. This will keep the package self-contained without its dependencies polluting the system, e.g. with python venv: 

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv # creates a venv name 'venv' in a hidden directory on unix 

source ./.venv/bin/activate # activate the environment
```

Then, install the package from pypi:
```bash 
pip install heiplanet-models 
```
In order to be able to visualize the computational graphs of the models you use or build, you need to install the package with the `viz` option. This will install the graphviz python package which will take care of the visualization. 

```bash
pip install .[viz]
```
Note that if you are using zsh (default on macos), you need to add quotes

```bash
pip install ".[viz]"
```
Graphviz itself has additional dependencies it needs to install. For more details, see [here](https://github.com/xflr6/graphviz?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). 

## For development 
Clone the repository 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssciwr/onehealth-model-backend.git
```
Create some virtual environment as described above.
Then, go to the base directory of the repository, and run 
```bash
pip install -e .
```
or including the graphviz dependency: 

```bash
pip install -e .[viz]
```
again, you need to take care of shell specifics, e.g. on zsh: 

```bash
pip install -e ".[viz]"
```
Please note the remark on graphviz's dependencies above.

## Troubleshooting
to be done.
