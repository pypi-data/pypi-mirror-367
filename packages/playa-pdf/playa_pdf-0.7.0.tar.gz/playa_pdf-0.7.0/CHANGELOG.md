  element (if any) via the parent tree
- Descend into Form XObjects in `Page.xobjects`

- BREAKING: Remove misleading `char_width`, `get_descent`, and
  `get_ascent` methods and `hscale` and `vscale` properties from font
  objects
- BREAKING: Do not guess `basename` for Type3 fonts (generally it
  isn't different from `fontname` for other subset fonts)

  and `structure.ContentObject`

## PLAYA 0.5.0: 2025-05-14

- Remove use of `object` in type annotations
- Add support for role map and standard structure types
- Refactor page.py as it was getting really unwieldy
- Add missing `ctm` to content objects in metadata API
- Somewhat improve untagged text extraction where the CTM is exotic
- Correct character and word spacing to apply after all glyphs
- Correct vertical writing to fully support glyph-specific position
  vectors, even totally absurd ones
- Correct horizontal scaling to apply to vertical writing, including
  the position vector
- Add `bbox` and `contents` to structure elements
- Add `origin` and `displacement` to glyphs
- Add `size` to glyphs and texts to get effective font size (still not
  entirely accurate when there is rotation or skewing)
- Support PDF 2.0 `Length` attribute on inline images
- Add `font` property to documents and pages
- BREAKING: `find` and `find_all` in structure search by standard
  structure types (roles)
- BREAKING: `parent_tree` moved to `playa.structure.Tree`
- BREAKING: `Point`, `Rect`, `Matrix` and `PDFObject` moved to
  `playa.pdftypes`
- BREAKING: `PathObject` no longer contains "subpaths", it is safe to
  recursively descend it now
- BREAKING: Content objects moved to `playa.content` and interpreter
  to `playa.interp`
- BREAKING: Text state no longer exists in the public API, text
  objects have immutable line matrix and glyph offset now, and
  everything else is in the graphic state
- BREAKING: `text_space_` properties are removed since what they
  returned was not actually text space (and maybe not useful either)
- BREAKING: `glyph_offset` is removed from glyphs and made private in
  text objects, as it is not in a well defined space.
- BREAKING: Glyph `bbox` now has a precise definition, which isn't
  exactly the glyph bounding box but is a lot closer.  This means
  notably that adjacent glyphs may overlap or may not touch, which is
  why you should **never** use the `bbox` to detect word boundaries.
  Use `origin` and `displacement` instead, please!
- BREAKING: `cid2unicode` attribute of fonts is removed as it doesn't
  make any sense for Type3 or CID fonts.
