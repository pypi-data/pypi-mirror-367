=========
screamlab
=========

Welcome! This is screamlab, a Python package for the evaluation of relaxation processes in multi-spin system observed by  SCREAM-DNP (Specific Cross Relaxation Enhancement by Active Motions under Dynamic Nuclear Polarization).


Features
========

A list of features:

* Spectral deconvolution with various possible lineshapes (Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigtian)

* Global fitting of spectra with consistent parameters

* Subsequent fitting of peak areas over time with exponential or biexponential behavior, or involving Solomon equations for a more complex fitting.


And to make it even more convenient for users and future-proof:

* Open source project written in Python (>= 3.7)

* High test coverage

* Extensive user and API documentation
