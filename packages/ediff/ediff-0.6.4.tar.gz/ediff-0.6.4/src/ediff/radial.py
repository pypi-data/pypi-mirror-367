def calc_radial_distribution(arr, center=None, output_file=None):
    """
    Calculate 1D radially averaged distrubution profile
    from 2D diffraction pattern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : 2D-numpy array
        The numpy array which contains the 2D-diffractogram.
    center : tuple/list of two floats, optional, default is None
        The accurate coordinates of the 2D-diffractogram.
        This argument should be determined by ediff.center.CenterLocator
        to get the best results.
        If not given (= if it defaults to None), the center is determined
        an approximate procedure using intensity center,
        without any refinement;
        this is imprecise, especially in case of
        diffraction patterns with a beamstopper.
    output_file : str, optional, default is None
        Name of the output file.
        If given, the calculated 1D profile is saved to *output_file*.

    Returns
