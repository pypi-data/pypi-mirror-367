Module: ediff.calibration
-------------------------

The calibration of electron diffraction patterns:

* The original diffraction pattern
  shows intensities as a function of *distance-in-pixels*.
* The calibrated diffraction pattern
  shows intensities as a function of *distance-in-q-vectors*.
* The term *distance-in-q-vectors*
  means that the distances = magnitudes of q-vector in [1/A].
* This module gives the *calibration constant*,
  which converts *distance-in-pixels* to *distance-in-q-vectors*.
* The final conversion is very simple:
  `distance_in_q = distance_in_pixels * calibration_constant`

Various ways how to determine the calibration constant:

* The calibration constant can be
  *calculated* or *determined* by various functions in this module.
* The calculations/determinations are not difficult,
  but we need at least one of the following:
    - ELD and XRD profiles
      => see ediff.calibration.Calculate.from_max_peaks function
    - some microscope parameters
      => see ediff.calibration.Calculate.from_microscope_parameters function
    - a pre-calibrated microscope
      => see the documentation at the begiining of
      ediff.calibration.Microscopes dataclass
* Examples in this documentation:
    - *Calculation* of calibration constant for an *arbitrary microscope*
      => see ediff.calibration.Calculate class.
    - *Determination* of calibration constant for a *known microscope*
      => see ediff.calibration.Microscopes class.
    - Real life examples can be found in EDIFF website

        Technical notes
        ---------------
        * ELD profile = 1D radially averaged
          powder electron diffraction pattern
            - in EDIFF, it is obtained from an experimental 2D difractogram
        * XRD profile = 1D powder X-ray diffraction pattern
            - in EDIFF, it is calculated from a standard CIF file
              = Crystallographic Information File
        * EDIFF format of ELD and XRD profiles employed in EDIFF package
            - ELD and XRD profiles can come in the form of files or np.arrays
            - Columns in files <=> rows in np.arrays (we use: *unpack=True*)
            - ELD profile = 3 cols = pixels, intensity, bkgr-corrected-intsty
            - XRD profile = 4 cols = 2theta[deg], S[1/A], q[1/A], norm-intsty
        * EDIFF calculation of ELD and XRD profiles is best seen from examples:

        * The parameters we need to know are: (i) accelerating_voltage,

        Technical notes
        ---------------
        * This calculation is based on four microscope parameters,
          namely: (i) accelerating_voltage, (ii) camera_length_mm,
          (iii) camera_pixel_size, and (iv) binning.
        * Nevertheless, three of the parameters may change
          from experiment to experiment:
            - *accelerating_voltage_kV* for given TEM
              can be changed by user (although it is not typical).
            - *camera_length_mm* is routinely adjusted
              to see the desired range of difractions;
              the TEM software usually displays some information
              about the nominal camera length.
            - *binning* averages the neighboring pixels of the camera;
              For example, the binning=1,2,4,...
              increases the pixel size 1x,2x,4x,..
        * IMPORTANT: The nominal camera length
          shown by the microscope (*D*)
          may not be the correct camera lenght (*camera_length_mm*)
          needed for the calculation.
            - Possible reasons: Exact amera position (bottom x upper camera),
              projective lenses (which may change the magnification
              of the diffraction pattern.
            - Real-life solution: we need to know real *camera_length_mm*
              for each theoretical/nominal/TEM-software-displayed
              cammera length *D*!
