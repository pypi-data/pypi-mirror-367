  - [Adding check constraints](https://django-pg-migration-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/operations.html#SaferAddCheckConstraint)
  - [Removing check constraints](https://django-pg-migration-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/operations.html#SaferRemoveCheckConstraint)
  - [Adding indexes (concurrently)](https://django-pg-migration-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/operations.html#SaferAddIndexConcurrently)
  - [Removing indexes (concurrently)](https://django-pg-migration-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/operations.html#SaferRemoveIndexConcurrently)

  - Run migrations with `statement_timeout` and `lock_timeout` by using
    [migrate_with_timeouts](https://django-pg-migration-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/management_commands.html#migrate-with-timeouts)
