# /plan - Specification-Driven Planning & Progress Management

## Purpose
Design specifications, plan work through spec-driven development, manage projects, track progress, and make strategic decisions. Combines specification management with progress visualization and architectural planning.

## Usage
```
/plan                           # Create new specification (default)
/plan "User Auth"               # Create new specification with title
/plan --complete               # Complete current specification
/plan --analyze                # Deep strategic analysis
/plan --architecture          # Architectural planning mode
/plan --status                 # Show specification status dashboard
```

## Auto-Intelligence

### Multi-Mode Planning
```yaml
Mode Detection:
  - No args ‚Üí Specification creation wizard (creates in draft/)
  - With title ‚Üí Create spec with given title
  - --complete ‚Üí Completion validation
  - --analyze ‚Üí Strategic analysis
  - --architecture ‚Üí System design planning
  - --status ‚Üí Show specification status dashboard
```

### Agent Orchestration
```yaml
Specification Design (Chained):
  - planner: Analyze requirements and create planning data
  - speccer: Transform planning data into valid YAML specification
  - architect: Validate technical approach
  - implementer: Estimate complexity
  
Progress Analysis:
  - researcher: Gather spec status and metrics
  - architect: Analyze system evolution
  
Project Planning:
  - architect: Design project structure
  - planner: Break down into specifications
  - security: Risk assessment
  
Strategic Analysis:
  - architect: Technical debt and opportunities
  - researcher: Pattern analysis
  - All agents: Domain-specific insights
```

## Execution: Analyze ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Track ‚Üí Archive

### Agent-Driven Execution

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: FOR DEFAULT MODE (CREATING SPECIFICATIONS):**
1. **SKIP workflow-coordinator** - Not needed for spec creation
2. **DIRECTLY CHAIN**: planner ‚Üí speccer agents
3. **planner agent**: Analyzes requirements and outputs structured planning data
4. **speccer agent**: Receives planning data and generates valid YAML specification

**Workflow by Mode:**
- **Default mode (no args or with title)**: 
  - **IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Chain planner ‚Üí speccer agents
  - **NO WORKFLOW COORDINATOR NEEDED**
  - planner analyzes requirements ‚Üí outputs planning data
  - speccer receives planning data ‚Üí generates YAML specification
  
- **--analyze mode**: Use architect, researcher, and security agents for analysis
- **--architecture mode**: Use the architect agent with security and implementer support
- **--status mode**: Use the researcher agent to analyze project status
- **--complete mode**: Use workflow-coordinator to validate completion readiness

### Folder Management Integration
**Automatic folder-based specification lifecycle:**
```yaml
On First Run:
  - Initialize FolderManager with .quaestor/spec/
  - Create folder structure: draft/, active/, completed/
  - Create manifest.yaml if missing:
    ```yaml
    version: "1.0"
    created: YYYY-MM-DD
    specifications: []
    ```
  - Update manifest with specification entries

Folder Operations:
  - New spec ‚Üí Create in draft/
  - Start work ‚Üí Move to active/ (max 3)
  - Complete ‚Üí Move to completed/
  - All moves atomic with git tracking

Specification Context:
  - Use active/ folder specs as source of truth
  - Context loaded directly from active specifications
  - Completed specs archived in completed/ folder
```

### Specification Creation (Default Mode) üéØ
**Create new specifications with contracts and acceptance criteria:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY AGENT CHAIN FOR SPEC CREATION:**
1. **planner agent** (FIRST): Analyzes requirements and outputs structured planning data
2. **speccer agent** (SECOND): Receives planning data from planner and generates valid YAML specification

**DO NOT USE workflow-coordinator for spec creation - go directly to planner ‚Üí speccer chain**
```yaml
Data Collection (Parallel):
  - Folder statistics: draft/active/completed counts via FolderManager
  - Active specifications: Read from active/ folder (max 3)
  - Active work: Read directly from active specifications
  - Git metrics: commits, velocity, contributors
  - Quality metrics: test/lint status per spec
  - Architecture health: dependency analysis
  - Project progress: folder-based completion tracking

## Specification Creation Workflow (--spec or default)

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: THIS IS THE REQUIRED WORKFLOW FOR CREATING SPECIFICATIONS**

**MANDATORY Agent Chain (NO workflow-coordinator):**
```yaml
Agent Chain:
  Step 1 - Planning (ALWAYS FIRST):
    agent: planner
    input: User requirements and context  
    output: Structured planning data (YAML format)
    
  Step 2 - Generation (RECEIVES PLANNER OUTPUT):
    agent: speccer
    input: Planning data from planner (passed directly)
    output: Valid YAML specification in draft/ folder
    
IMPORTANT: 
  - DO NOT use workflow-coordinator for spec creation
  - ALWAYS chain planner ‚Üí speccer in that exact order
  - The planner's output becomes the speccer's input
```

### Initial Setup
```yaml
Directory Structure:
  - Use FolderManager to create folder structure:
    - draft/     # New specifications start here
    - active/    # In-progress (max 3 specifications)
    - completed/ # Finished specifications
  - Automatic migration of existing flat specifications
  - Git integration for history preservation
```

### Guided Specification Process
```yaml
Context Gathering:
  1. Title: "What feature/fix are you planning?"
  2. Type: "Is this a feature, bugfix, refactor, etc?"
  3. Description: "What exactly needs to be built?"
  4. Rationale: "Why is this needed?"

Contract Definition:
  1. Inputs: "What data/parameters are required?"
  2. Outputs: "What will be produced/returned?"
  3. Behavior: "What are the key rules/logic?"
  4. Constraints: "Any performance/security requirements?"

Acceptance Criteria:
  - Define: measurable success conditions
  - Create: test scenarios with Given/When/Then
  - Link: to existing specifications if dependent

Branch Creation:
  - Generate: spec-compliant branch name
  - Link: specification to branch
  - Update: spec status to ACTIVE

Manifest Update:
  - Add spec entry to .quaestor/spec/manifest.yaml
  - Track: ID, title, type, status, location
  - Maintain: chronological order of specifications
```

### Specification Output Template
```yaml
Specification Created:
  ID: feat-auth-001
  Title: User Authentication System
  Type: feature
  Priority: high
  Status: DRAFT ‚Üí ACTIVE
  
  Contract:
    Inputs:
      - username: string (required)
      - password: string (required, min 8 chars)
    Outputs:
      - token: JWT string
      - user: User object
    Behavior:
      - Validate credentials against database
      - Generate JWT with 24h expiration
      - Log authentication attempts
      
  Branch: feat/spec-auth-001-user-authentication
  Folder: draft/ ‚Üí Will move to active/ when work begins
  
  Next Steps:
  1. Review specification contract
  2. Start implementation according to acceptance criteria
  3. Run /plan --complete spec-auth-001 when finished
```


## Advanced Planning Modes

### Strategic Analysis Mode (--analyze)
**Deep Technical and Architectural Analysis:**

**Use the architect agent for system design evaluation, the researcher agent for pattern analysis, and the security agent for risk assessment.**
```yaml
Multi-Agent Analysis:
  - architect: System design evaluation
  - researcher: Pattern and debt analysis
  - security: Risk assessment
  - implementer: Performance review

Output Structure:

- **Quality system** ‚Üí Integrated validation per specification
- **Hooks** ‚Üí Specification tracking and validation

## Implementation Guide

**Using FolderManager:**
```python
from quaestor.core.folder_manager import FolderManager

# Initialize manager
folder_mgr = FolderManager(Path(".quaestor/spec"))

# First run - setup folders
result = folder_mgr.create_folder_structure()
if result.success:
    # Migrate existing specs
    folder_mgr.migrate_flat_specifications()

# Specifications are automatically moved between folders
# based on lifecycle status and TODO completion
```

**Folder Operations:**
- Create spec ‚Üí Save to draft/
- Activate ‚Üí Check limit, move to active/
- Complete ‚Üí Move to completed/, update memory
- All operations atomic with rollback
