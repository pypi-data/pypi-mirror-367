# /review - Comprehensive Review & Ship

## Purpose
Final quality validation, intelligent commit generation, and PR creation. Combines thorough code review, automated fixes, commit organization, and shipping preparation with multi-agent expertise.

## Usage
```
/review                    # Full review, fix issues, generate commits, create PR
/review --commit-only      # Generate commits from recent changes
/review --validate-only    # Run all quality checks and fix issues
/review --pr-only         # Create PR from existing commits
/review --analysis        # Deep code quality analysis
/review --quick           # Fast review for small changes
/review --archive-spec <spec-id>  # Archive completed specification
```

## Auto-Intelligence

### Multi-Mode Review
```yaml
Mode Detection:
  - No args ‚Üí Full review pipeline
  - --commit-only ‚Üí Smart commit generation
  - --validate-only ‚Üí Quality fixing focus
  - --pr-only ‚Üí PR creation from commits
  - --analysis ‚Üí Deep quality insights
  - --archive-spec ‚Üí Archive completed specification
```

### Agent Orchestration
```yaml
Parallel Review:
  - refactorer: Code quality and style
  - security: Vulnerability scanning
  - qa: Test coverage and quality
  - implementer: Documentation completeness
  
Sequential Workflow:
  1. Validate: Run all quality checks
  2. Fix: Auto-fix all issues
  3. Commit: Generate organized commits
  4. Review: Final multi-agent review
  5. Ship: Create PR with insights
```

## Workflow: Validate ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Ship

**FIRST, use the workflow-coordinator agent to validate workflow state before review.**

The workflow-coordinator will:
- Verify implementation phase has been completed
- Check that all tasks in the specification are done
- Ensure tests are passing before review
- Coordinate the transition to review/completion phase

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Validation üîç
**Multi-Domain Quality Checks:**
```yaml
Parallel Validation (All Agents):
  Code Quality:
    - Linting: ruff, eslint, clippy
    - Formatting: prettier, rustfmt
    - Complexity: cyclomatic, cognitive
    - Patterns: best practices compliance
    
  Security:
    - Vulnerability scan: known CVEs
    - Input validation: sanitization
    - Auth patterns: secure flows
    - Secrets: no hardcoded keys
    
  Testing:
    - Coverage: minimum thresholds
    - Test quality: assertions, mocks
    - Edge cases: boundary testing
    - Performance: no regressions
    
  Documentation:
    - API docs: completeness
    - Code comments: clarity
    - README: up to date
    - Examples: working code
```

**Quality Gate Requirements:**
```yaml
Must Pass:
  - ‚úÖ Zero linting errors
  - ‚úÖ All tests passing
  - ‚úÖ Security scan clean
  - ‚úÖ Type checking valid
  - ‚úÖ Build successful
  
Should Pass:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Test coverage >80%
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation complete
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è No TODOs in critical paths
```

### Phase 2: Intelligent Auto-Fixing ‚ö°
**Agent-Driven Fixes:**
```yaml
Fix Strategy:
  Simple Issues (Direct Fix):
    - Formatting: auto-format all files
    - Import sorting: organize imports
    - Trailing spaces: clean up
    - Simple type annotations: add obvious types
    
  Complex Issues (Agent Delegation):
    - Test failures ‚Üí qa agent
    - Security vulnerabilities ‚Üí security agent
    - Performance issues ‚Üí implementer agent
    - Documentation gaps ‚Üí implementer agent
    
  Parallel Execution:
    - Spawn multiple agents for different domains
    - Coordinate fixes to avoid conflicts
    - Verify fixes don't break other areas
```

### Phase 3: Smart Commit Generation üìù
**Intelligent Commit Organization:**
```yaml
Change Analysis:
  - Group: related changes by module/feature
  - Classify: feat|fix|docs|refactor|test|perf
  - Extract: scope from file paths
  - Generate: conventional commit messages

Commit Strategy:
  Atomic Commits:
    - One logical change per commit
    - Include tests with implementation
    - Keep refactoring separate
    
  Message Generation:
    Template: "type(scope): description"
    
    Examples:
    - "feat(auth): implement JWT refresh tokens"
    - "fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint"
    - "test(auth): add coverage for edge cases"
    - "docs(api): update OpenAPI specifications"

TODO Integration:
  - Link commits to completed TODOs
  - Update specification progress
  - Track completion evidence
```

### Phase 4: Multi-Agent Review ü§ñ
**Comprehensive Code Review:**
```yaml
Review Aspects:
  Code Quality (refactorer):
    - Readability and clarity
    - DRY principle compliance
    - SOLID principles
    - Design patterns usage
    
  Security (security):
    - Input validation
    - Authentication flows
    - Data exposure risks
    - Dependency vulnerabilities
    
  Testing (qa):
    - Test coverage adequacy
    - Edge case handling
    - Mock appropriateness
    - Performance benchmarks
    
  Architecture (architect):
    - Component boundaries
    - Dependency directions
    - Abstraction levels
    - Future extensibility

Review Output:
  üìä Review Summary
  
  ‚úÖ Strengths:
  ‚Ä¢ Clean architecture in auth module
  ‚Ä¢ Comprehensive test coverage (87%)
  ‚Ä¢ Good error handling patterns
  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Suggestions:
  ‚Ä¢ Consider caching in user service
  ‚Ä¢ Add rate limiting to API endpoints
  ‚Ä¢ Refactor large processor function
  
  üö® Required Fixes:
  ‚Ä¢ None - all critical issues resolved
```

### Phase 5: PR Creation & Shipping üöÄ
**Intelligent PR Assembly:**
```yaml
PR Content Generation:
  Title: 
    - Extract from specifications or changes
    - Follow team conventions
    - Include ticket numbers if found
    
  Description:
    ## Summary
    [Auto-generated from specifications/changes]
