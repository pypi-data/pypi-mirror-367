Git-Narrate is a Python tool that transforms git repository metadata into a human-readable narrative. It analyzes commit history, branches, tags, and contributor activity to generate a chronological story of a project's development, highlighting key events, milestones, and evolution patterns.

## Features

- **Repository Analysis**: Extracts commit history, branches, tags, and contributor statistics
- **Narrative Generation**: Creates human-readable stories in multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, plain text)
- **Visualization**: Generates timeline and contributor activity charts
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface
- **Customizable Output**: Flexible output options for different use cases

## Installation

### From PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install git-narrate
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/git-narrate/git-narrate.git
cd git-narrate
pip install .
```

For development installation:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Quick Start

Generate a narrative for a git repository:

```bash
git-narrate /path/to/your/repository
```

This will create a Markdown file named `git_story.md` in the repository directory.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
git-narrate /path/to/repo
```

### Specify Output Format and Location

```bash
git-narrate /path/to/repo --output=story.html --format=html
```

### Generate Visualizations

```bash
git-narrate /path/to/repo --visualize
```

This will generate two PNG files:
- `timeline.png`: Shows commit activity over time
- `contributors.png`: Shows contributor activity

### Generate Only Visualizations (no narrative)

```bash
git-narrate /path/to/repo --visualize --no-narrative
```

### Command Line Options

```
Usage: git-narrate [OPTIONS] REPO_PATH

  Generate a human-readable story of a git repository's development.

Options:
  -o, --output PATH           Output file path
  -f, --format [markdown|html|text]
                              Output format
  -v, --visualize             Generate visualization charts
  --no-narrative              Skip narrative generation (visualize only)
  --use-ai                    Use AI model for story generation (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
  --ai-model TEXT             AI model to use (default: glm-4.5-flash)
  --help                      Show this message and exit.
```

## AI-Powered Narrative Generation

Git-Narrate can leverage AI models to generate more sophisticated and engaging narratives. This feature requires an API key for the Z.ai platform (using the `glm-4.5-flash` model by default).

### Setup for AI Generation

1.  **Get an API Key**: Obtain an API key from Z.ai.
2.  **Set Environment Variable**: Set your API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
    *   On Linux/macOS: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"`
    *   On Windows (Command Prompt): `set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"`
    *   On Windows (PowerShell): `$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"`
    *   Alternatively, create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add `OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"` to it.

### Usage with AI

```bash
git-narrate /path/to/repo --use-ai
```

This will generate an AI-powered narrative. You can also specify a different AI model if needed (e.g., `--ai-model glm-4.5`).

### Data Privacy and AI Generation

When using the `--use-ai` flag, Git-Narrate sends processed repository metadata (including project name, timeline events, contributor information, and the content of your `README.md` file) to the Z.ai API.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Sensitive Data in README.md**: Ensure that your `README.md` file does not contain any sensitive or proprietary information that you do not wish to share with the AI service.
*   **Commit Messages**: While Git-Narrate extracts high-level plot points from commit messages, be mindful that detailed or sensitive information in commit messages could be part of the data sent to the AI.
*   **API Key Security**: Your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is used for authentication with the Z.ai API and should be kept secure. It is recommended to use environment variables or a `.env` file for this purpose.

Git-Narrate aims to provide an accurate and engaging story based on your repository's history while respecting data privacy.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Markdown Story

```bash
git-narrate ~/projects/my-awesome-app
```

Creates a Markdown file with the story of `my-awesome-app` development.

### Example 2: HTML Story with Visualizations

```bash
git-narrate ~/projects/my-awesome-app --output=history.html --format=html --visualize
```

Creates an HTML file with the story and PNG files with visualizations.

### Example 3: Only Visualizations

```bash
git-narrate ~/projects/my-awesome-app --visualize --no-narrative
```

Generates only the visualization charts without a narrative.

## Output Samples

## How It Works

1. **Repository Analysis**: Git-Narrate uses GitPython to analyze the git repository, extracting:
   - Commit history (author, date, message, files changed)
   - Branches and merge points
   - Tags and releases
   - Contributor activity statistics

2. **Milestone Detection**: The tool identifies key milestones in the repository history:
   - Initial commit
   - Releases (tags)
   - Major merges

3. **Phase Grouping**: Commits are grouped into development phases (monthly by default) to show the evolution of the project over time.

4. **Narrative Generation**: The structured data is transformed into a human-readable story using natural language generation techniques.

5. **Visualization**: Optional charts are generated to visualize repository activity and contributor statistics.

### 5. docs/usage.md

```markdown
# Git-Narrate Usage Guide

This guide provides detailed information on how to use Git-Narrate to analyze git repositories and generate development narratives.

## Installation

Before using Git-Narrate, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then install Git-Narrate:

```bash
pip install git-narrate
```

For development installation, see the [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to use Git-Narrate is to provide a path to a git repository:

```bash
git-narrate /path/to/your/repository
```

This will analyze the repository and create a Markdown file named `git_story.md` in the repository directory.

## Command Line Options

Git-Narrate provides several command line options to customize its behavior:

### Output Options

- `--output`, `-o`: Specify the output file path
  ```bash
  git-narrate /path/to/repo --output=my_project_story.md
  ```

- `--format`, `-f`: Specify the output format (markdown, html, or text)
  ```bash
  git-narrate /path/to/repo --format=html
  ```

### Visualization Options

- `--visualize`, `-v`: Generate visualization charts
  ```bash
  git-narrate /path/to/repo --visualize
  ```

- `--no-narrative`: Skip narrative generation (only generate visualizations)
  ```bash
  git-narrate /path/to/repo --visualize --no-narrative
  ```

## Examples

### Example 1: Generate a Markdown Story

```bash
git-narrate ~/projects/my-awesome-app
```

This creates a Markdown file named `git_story.md` in the `~/projects/my-awesome-app` directory.

### Example 2: Generate an HTML Story with Custom Output Path

```bash
git-narrate ~/projects/my-awesome-app --output=~/docs/history.html --format=html
```

This creates an HTML file named `history.html` in the `~/docs` directory.

### Example 3: Generate Visualizations Only

```bash
git-narrate ~/projects/my-awesome-app --visualize --no-narrative
```

This generates two PNG files in the repository directory:
- `timeline.png`: Shows commit activity over time
- `contributors.png`: Shows contributor activity

### Example 4: Generate a Complete Report with Visualizations

```bash
git-narrate ~/projects/my-awesome-app --output=~/reports/report.html --format=html --visualize
```

This creates an HTML report with visualizations in the `~/reports` directory and PNG files in the repository directory.

## Understanding the Output

### Narrative Output

The narrative output is structured into several sections:

1. **Overview**: Provides summary statistics about the repository
2. **Key Milestones**: Highlights important events in the repository's history
3. **Development Phases**: Groups commits into time-based phases and summarizes activity
4. **Contributors**: Details about each contributor's activity

### Visualization Output

Git-Narrate generates two types of visualizations:

1. **Timeline Visualization**: A bar chart showing commit activity over time
   - X-axis: Time (months)
   - Y-axis: Number of commits
   - Each bar represents the number of commits in a month

2. **Contributors Visualization**: A horizontal bar chart showing contributor activity
   - Y-axis: Contributor names
   - X-axis: Number of commits
   - Each bar represents the number of commits by a contributor

## Advanced Usage

### Analyzing Remote Repositories

Currently, Git-Narrate works with local git repositories. To analyze a remote repository:

1. Clone the repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
   ```
2. Run Git-Narrate on the local clone:
   ```bash
   git-narrate repo
   ```

### Customizing the Narrative

The narrative generation is based on heuristics to identify important events and phases. You can influence the narrative by:

1. **Using clear commit messages**: Git-Narrate analyzes commit messages to identify significant changes
2. **Using tags**: Tags are treated as release milestones
3. **Using branch names**: Branch names are included in the analysis

### Large Repositories

For large repositories with many commits, Git-Narrate may take longer to analyze. You can:

1. Use the `--no-narrative` option to generate only visualizations
2. Consider analyzing specific branches or time periods (future feature)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Not a git repository" error**
   - Ensure the path you provide is a git repository (contains a `.git` directory)
   - Check if you have read permissions for the repository

2. **"No commits found" error**
   - The repository might be empty (no commits)
   - Check if you're in the correct branch

3. **Visualization files not generated**
   - Ensure you have the required visualization dependencies installed
   - Check if you have write permissions in the output directory

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. Check the [issues](https://github.com/git-narrate/git-narrate/issues) page
2. Create a new issue with details about your problem
3. Include the command you ran and any error messages
```

## Extending Git-Narrate

### Adding New Output Formats

To add a new output format:

1. Add a new method to the `RepoNarrator` class in `narrator.py`:
   ```python
   def _generate_new_format(self) -> str:
       # Implementation for the new format
       pass
   ```

2. Update the `generate_story()` method to handle the new format:
   ```python
   def generate_story(self, output_format: str = "markdown") -> str:
       if output_format.lower() == "new_format":
           return self._generate_new_format()
       # ... existing code ...
   ```

3. Update the CLI in `cli.py` to include the new format in the choices:
   ```python
   @click.option("--format", "-f", "output_format", 
                 type=click.Choice(["markdown", "html", "text", "new_format"], case_sensitive=False),
                 default="markdown", help="Output format")
   ```

### Adding New Visualizations

To add a new visualization:

1. Add a new method to the `RepoVisualizer` class in `visualizer.py`:
   ```python
   def plot_new_visualization(self, output_path: Path):
       # Implementation for the new visualization
       pass
   ```

2. Update the CLI in `cli.py` to include an option for the new visualization:
   ```python
   @click.option("--new-viz", is_flag=True, help="Generate new visualization")
   def main(repo_path, output, output_format, visualize, no_narrative, new_viz):
       # ...
       if new_viz:
           visualizer.plot_new_visualization(repo_path / "new_viz.png")
       # ...
   ```

### Adding New Analysis Features

To add a new analysis feature:

1. Add a new method to the `RepoAnalyzer` class in `analyzer.py`:
   ```python
   def _get_new_feature(self) -> SomeDataType:
       # Implementation for the new feature
       pass
   ```

2. Update the `analyze()` method to include the new feature:
   ```python
   def analyze(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       return {
           # ... existing data ...
           "new_feature": self._get_new_feature()
       }
   ```

3. Update the `RepoNarrator` class to use the new feature in the narrative generation if needed.
