- ✅ **Explanatory note**: Added "👥 = Multi-AZ (2x pricing)" note at bottom
- ✅ **Professional layout**: Table looks polished and information-dense

### 7. **Help Menu Overhaul** ❓
- ✅ **Dynamic shortcuts**: Only lowercase letters, assigned dynamically at runtime
- ✅ **Column order**: Shortcuts now match exact table column order (not alphabetical)
- ✅ **Compact layout**: Horizontal 4-per-row arrangement with proper spacing
- ✅ **Bottom popup**: Clean popup panel at bottom (3:2 ratio) with blue border
- ✅ **Readable text**: Changed "$" to "pricing" for clarity
- ✅ **Visibility fix**: All help text now visible in small terminals
- ✅ **Intuitive flow**: Shortcuts follow left-to-right table reading pattern
