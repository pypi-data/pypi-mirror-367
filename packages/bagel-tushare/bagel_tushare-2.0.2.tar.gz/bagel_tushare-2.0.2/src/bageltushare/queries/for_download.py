This module is the queries used in downloading/update process

For "date loop update", the loop will loop through the trade_date 
from the latest date in the corresponding table to the current date.

For "code loop update", the loop will loop through the all the ts_code,
each ts_code we need to update from the latest date to current date.

In this module, we will have the queries for both of them.
