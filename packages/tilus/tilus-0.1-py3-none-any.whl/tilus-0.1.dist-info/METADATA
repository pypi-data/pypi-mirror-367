# Tilus: A Domain-Specific Language for High-Performance GPU Programming

**Tilus** is a domain-specific language (DSL) for GPU programming, designed with:

* Thread-block-level granularity and tensors as the core data type
* Explicit control over shared memory and tensor layouts (unlike Triton)
* Support for low-precision types with arbitrary bit-widths

Additional features include automatic tuning, caching, and a Pythonic interface for ease of use.

Tilus is proununced as tie-lus, /ˈtaɪləs/.
