# torch-datasets

Note: This is a placeholder release to reserve the package name. A proper release will follow soon.

**One toolkit for all your PyTorch data loading needs.**  
_Still cooking — stay tuned!_

---

## 🚀 Overview

**torch-datasets** is a unified, flexible, and extensible toolkit for handling dataset loading in PyTorch. Whether you're working with images, text, audio, tabular data, or custom formats, `torch-datasets` aims to make your data loading pipeline simple, efficient, and scalable.

> 🔧 This project is currently under active development — stay tuned for updates and releases!

---

## ✨ Features (Planned)

- Built-in support for popular dataset formats (images, text, tabular, audio)
- Easy-to-use wrappers for custom datasets
- Fast data loading using multiprocessing and caching
- Simple APIs for train/val/test splitting
- Seamless integration with `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`
- Directory-based loading with automatic labeling
- Plugin system for extending dataset types
- Designed with reproducibility and best practices in mind

---

## Installation

**Coming soon to PyPI!**

For now, you can install the development version directly from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/torch-datasets.git
cd torch-datasets
pip install -e .
````

---

## 🧑‍💻 Quick Start

```python
from torchdatasets.vision.classification import FromSubDirDataset
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import transforms

# Define any transformations
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])

# Load images from a directory structure: root/class_x/xxx.png
dataset = ImageFolderDataset("path/to/images", transform=transform)

# Create a DataLoader
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Training loop
for images, labels in dataloader:
    # Your model training code here
    pass
```
