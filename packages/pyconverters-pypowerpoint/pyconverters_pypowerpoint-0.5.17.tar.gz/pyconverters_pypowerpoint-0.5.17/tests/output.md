CaaS as seen by our customers

_WHAT IT IS_

Ready\-to\-publish information or entertainment content feeds

Content: text\, images\, videos\, audio or everything mixed together

Directly embedded onto the product / service

Allow enhanced customer experience

Is part of the revenue model

Data: a tool for the brand to know more about its customers

_WHAT IT IS NOT_

Pieces of content \(text\, photo\, video\) used for communication purposes such as annual report\, blog post\, social media\, etc\.

Tailor\-made production

# Content as a service market needs

What is happening in the market

Brands onboard content streams onto their products as part of the product’s added value and experience\. Brands hereby use content as a raw material in their value chain\.

They use content to keep customers using more and better their product\, and learn about this usage to improve and adapt faster\.

In some advanced cases\, content becomes such a key element of the product’s experience that it has its own business model

__The __  __archetypal__  __ __  __way__  __ __  __it__  __ __  __works__

There is a pattern to keep in mind in the most obvious market cases:

A manufactured product \(hardware\)

With a human interface\, often a screen\, sometimes just voice\, operating a software

Displaying content to customers

The product is connected to internet and often has a mobile app synchronized in the cloud

The software sends usage data back to the brand to personalize the user’s experience and keep them hooked\.

# Who we should talk to

* The key industries we should target:
  * Mobility \(trains\, planes\, tramway\, subway\, bus\, Uber app\.\.\.\)
  * Automobile \(brands\, equipment engineering  and manufacturing groups\.\.\.\)
  * Consumer electronics and IoT \(basically every object with a screen\,  a speaker or a wifi portal\)
  * Commercial real\-estate \(malls\, airport\, stadiums\.\.\.\)
  * Education / edutech \(apps\.\.\.\)
  * Sports / well\-being \(gyms\, at\-home equipment\, connected bikes\.\.\.\)
  * Hospitality \(hotels and resort groups\, related players\)
  * Workplace \(co\-working spaces\, related players\)
  * Smart Cities \(JCDecaux\, local councils\.\.\.\)

From com’s & marketing to product & exprience

We must look for people working in the following department —sometimes overlapping depending on the organization charts:

Product teams

Customer/brand experience teams

Content or digital strategy teams

Data and insights teams

In the next slides we selected real LinkedIn to better render the type of profiles and the areas of expertise you should look for when trying to make your first move\.

People in charge are not the usual targets we are used to approach in corporate organization to push AFP content or even Factstory on\-demand services : forget about communications department and PR\.

_Product digital _  _strategy_  _ — _ IoT Industry

Content usage\, as other segment of the product’s experience\, is monitored by « data »\, « analytics »\, « user insights » teams\.

The managers of these teams are less likely to be the deciding buyers when looking for content suppliers  _but_  they are closely involved in the operations and should be considered as influential parties and relavant entry points as well\.

Background in these teams is more often IT and / or digital\.

Look also for job titles like:

_Digital _  _experience_

_Product Digital manager_

_Head of digital _  _experience_

_Passenger _  _experience_  _ — Commercial real\-_  _estate_  _ & _  _Mobility_

Mobility leads to ports— mostly airports but not only\.

Ports look at content just like any other commercial real\-estate would: they use a combination of public screens and mobile apps to make your journey more pleasant… and spend more money in the shops and services\.

Beyond airports\, think shopping malls\, commercial areas surrounding sport arenas and stadiums\.

Look also for job titles like:
