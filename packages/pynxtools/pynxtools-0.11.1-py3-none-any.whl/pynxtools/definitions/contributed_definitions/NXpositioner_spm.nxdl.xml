        Extending positioner from NXpositioner to maintain a measurement signal through
        a feedback loop, specialized for scanning probe microscopy applications.

        <doc>
            This controller's task is to continuously adjust the Z position of the STM/STS tip in order
            to keep the selected control signal as close as possible to the Set Point. Different control
            signals lead to different controller's behavior.
            
            The second PID feedback loop intends to position the tip in the Z direction.
            
            p_gain (proportional gain) from z_controller is the same as K_p value from PID controller.
            i_gain (integral gain) from z_controller is the same as K_i value from PID controller.
            setpoint from z_controller is the same as setpoint from PID controller.

                The derivative time constant of the derivative part of the PID controller. Proportional Derivative constant
