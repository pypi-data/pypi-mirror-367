# quantitativelib

A simple Python library for quantitative finance.
Fetch stock data, analyse returns, and compute Black-Scholes option prices and Greeks.

This functions mainly as a test to learn how packages are made, and hopefully to develop a customised quantitative finance library suited to my needs. Lots more to be added.
