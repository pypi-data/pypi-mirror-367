# EigenmodeAnalysis

Run an Eigenmode simulation in HFSS and extract modal frequencies and Q-factors.

This class wraps setup configuration, simulation execution, and result parsing
in a single, declarative interface. It's typically used in workflow configurations
to automate eigenmode extraction.
