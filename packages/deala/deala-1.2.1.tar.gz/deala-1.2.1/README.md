# 📦 DEALA — *Differentiated Economic Assessment in a Life cycle-oriented Analysis*

**DEALA** is a Python package developed to perform comprehensive and differentiated **economic assessments** within **Life Cycle (Sustainabiltiy) Assessment (LC(S)A)** or **Life Cycle Costing studies (LCC)**. It enables the integration of economic data and includes three pre-defined economic life cycle impact assessment methods for the calculation of the economic impacts. DEALA builds upon existing LCA frameworks such as [Brightway2](https://brightway.dev/) and supplements them with custom databases and impact categories tailored for economic evaluation.
