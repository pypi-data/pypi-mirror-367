> pdfnaut is currently in an early stage of development and has only been tested with a small set of compliant documents. Some non-compliant documents may work under strict=False. Expect bugs or issues.

pdfnaut aims to become a PDF processor for parsing PDF 2.0 files.

pdfnaut provides a high-level interface for reading and writing PDF documents as described in the [PDF 2.0 specification](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/assets/5b15559b96303194340b99820d3a70fa/PDF_ISO_32000-2.pdf) for actions such as reading and writing metadata, modifying and inserting pages, creating PDF objects, etc.

## Installation

pdfnaut requires at least Python 3.9 or later. To install pdfnaut via pip:

```plaintext
python -m pip install pdfnaut
```

If you plan to work with encrypted or protected PDF documents, you must install one of the supported crypt providers. See [Standard Security Handler](https://pdfnaut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/standard_handler.html#standard-security-handler) in the documentation for details.

## Examples

Example 1: Accessing the content stream of a page

```py
from pdfnaut import PdfDocument

pdf = PdfDocument.from_filename("tests/docs/sample.pdf")
for operator in pdf.pages[0].content_stream:
    print(operator)
```

Example 2: Reading document information

```py
from pdfnaut import PdfDocument

pdf = PdfDocument.from_filename("tests/docs/sample.pdf")
print(pdf.doc_info.title)
print(pdf.doc_info.author)
```
