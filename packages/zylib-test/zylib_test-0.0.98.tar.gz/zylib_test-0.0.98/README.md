**Writing technical documentation like API specs is often a burden for software engineers ‚Äî it‚Äôs not their expertise, and rarely a top priority. That‚Äôs where Zylo-docs comes in. Zylo-docs seamlessly integrates with FastAPI and automatically generates OpenAPI-compliant specs. With powerful AI assistance, it helps developers create clear, user-friendly, and rich documentation with minimal effort. Think of it as a more intuitive, AI-powered alternative to Swagger.**

## [1/7] Get Started (Add boilerplate code)
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
# üëá [1/2] Add this import at the top
from zylo_docs.integration import add_zylo_docs

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}

# ...
# ...
# ...

# üëá [2/2] Add this at the bottom of your entry point file (e.g., main.py)
add_zylo_docs(app)
```


## [2/7] Run the FastAPI Server
```python
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
You need to start the server using **Uvicorn**.

> ‚ö°Ô∏è **If your server is already running, you can skip this step.**

**Once the server is running, open your browser and go to: üëâ [http://localhost:8000/zylo-docs](http://localhost:8000/zylo-docs)** </br>
(‚ö†Ô∏è If your development server runs on a different port, update the URL accordingly!)

## [3/7] Tada! You can now view beautifully structured API specs with zylo-docs.
