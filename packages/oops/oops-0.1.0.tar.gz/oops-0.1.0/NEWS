0.0.13
------

* New publishers pprint_to_stream. Very useful for interactive observing of
  Oops reports  - just hook it up to your source (e.g. via oops_amqp) and
  off you go. (Robert Collins)

0.0.12
------

* No changes

0.0.11
------

* Changes to publishing to better support fallback publishing:

  * Using multiple publishers with an ``oops.Config`` object is now deprecated.
    Use the ``publisher`` attribute instead, and use
    ``oops.publishers.publish_to_many`` if you need to publish to many
    publishers at once.

  * If you are doing fallback publishing then ``publish_new_only`` is
    deprecated and you should use ``oops.publishers.publish_with_fallback``
    instead.

  * Publishers need to be updated to return lists rather than single objects.
    The new functions in ``oops.publishers`` (``publish_to_many`` and
    ``publish_with_fallback``) only take the new style publishers.
    If you have a publisher that uses the old return values then
    ``oops.publishers.convert_result_to_list`` can be used to wrap the
    publisher for use with the new functions.

  * Publishers that use the new return values can't be used with the
    deprecated ``oops.Config.publishers`` list.

  * The compatibility code of ``oops.Config.publishers``, ``publish_new_only``
    and ``convert_result_to_list`` will be removed in a later release.

0.0.10
------

* Change req_vars to be documented as a dict, mentioning the older list format
  for compatibility. (Robert Collins, #888866)

* Now licensed under LGPL-3. (Robert Collins)

0.0.9
-----

* Do not propogate oops ids of None to the report: they indicate that the oops
  was not handled. (Robert Collins)

* New helper function ``publish_new_only`` which lets you easily add fallback
  publishers: if the first publisher does not publish and instead returns None,
  ``publish_new_only`` will call the publisher it wraps. Otherwise it will just
  return None itself. (Robert Collins)

0.0.8
-----

* Attach the local hostname to reports by default. This permits differentiating
  different hosts in a cluster of the same reporters.  (Robert Collins)

0.0.7
-----

* Add well known key 'timeline' as a location for the 'sequence of things that
  led up to the OOPS'. See also the oops-timeline module which will populate this
  from a Timeline object.
