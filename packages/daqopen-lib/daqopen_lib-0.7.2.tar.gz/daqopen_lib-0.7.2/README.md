# daqopen-lib

This library can be used for various data acquisition tasks to proper handle streaming ADC data for building data acquisition applications.

**Documentation** incl. tutorials can be found here: [docs.daqopen.com](https://docs.daqopen.com)

Initially, it is build around the Arduino Due, which has a high-speed ADC with good accuracy and a data transfer via USB 2.0. Most of the examples and driver uses this model together with the firmware which can be found in the firmware folder.

## Features

- **ADC driver:** Driver for communicating with Arduino Due (included firmware) and packing the data to numpy arrays.
- **Circular Channel Buffer:** A class representing a circular buffer for holding needed amount of data for viewing, calculating and storing.
- **DAQ-Info Class:** Can be used to exchange informations regarding the interpretation of the data packages. It holds adjustment values and info about the acquisition rate.
- **ZMQ-Support:** Transfer the acquired data in realtime via zmq to other applications or hosts

## Intended Use

This library should be used if:

- you build long-running acquisition applications (e.g. measurement devices)

## Installation

Installation from pypi:

```bash
pip install daqopen-lib
```

Install latest directly from Github:

```
git clone https://github.com/DaqOpen/daqopen-lib.git
cd daqopen-lib
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### SIM (no hardware)

```python
from daqopen.duedaq import DueDaq
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create Instance of DueDaq
myDaq = DueDaq(serial_port_name="SIM")

# Start acquisition device
myDaq.start_acquisition()

# Read the buffer 10 times
for i in range(10):
    data = myDaq.read_data()

# Hold acqusition device
myDaq.stop_acquisition()

# Plot Data of last buffer
plt.plot(data)
plt.show()
```

### Arduino Due

#### Setting up Arduino IDE

- Download Arduino IDE for your plattform and start the app
- Install the Package to support SAM-Controllers:  Arduino SAM Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-
  M3) by Arduino of version **1.6.12**

#### Compiling and Downloading

- Open the sketch-file from firmware/due-daq/due-daq.ino
- Connect the Arduino Due to the "Programming Port" (the port near to the power socket)
- Compile and upload the firmware
- Disconnect from the "Programming Port"



Now, connect the "Native USB Port" (the port near the reset toggle) and use the following sketch for testing the Arduino acquisition:

```python
from daqopen.duedaq import DueDaq
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create Instance of DueDaq (use empty port name for automatic search)
myDaq = DueDaq()

# Start acquisition device
myDaq.start_acquisition()
for i in range(10):
    data = myDaq.read_data() # read buffer

# Hold acqusition device
myDaq.stop_acquisition()

# Plot Data of last buffer
plt.plot(data)
plt.show()
```

You should see something like this:

## Roadmap

A quick and dirty roadmap to show what is planned for the future:

- [ ] More practical examples
- [ ] Raspberry Pi Pico as DAQ device
- [ ] ...
