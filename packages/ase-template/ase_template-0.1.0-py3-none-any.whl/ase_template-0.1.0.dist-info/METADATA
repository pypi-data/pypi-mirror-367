# Agentic software engineering (ASE) template repository

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a public template for agentic software engineering (ASE), initially developed internally at [Ascend.io](https://ascend.io). We use a variety of tools like Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, and GitHub Copilot to assist in the software development process. This repository is designed to be a starting point for teams looking to implement ASE practices in their own projects.

## What?

Common context to be included in all agentic sessions are centralized in the [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) file. Tool-specific files are then symlinked or copied from this `AGENTS.md` file.

## Why?

Standards are hard [obligatory xkcd here]. Nobody agrees on the files -- let alone the exact extension -- to use for their ASE tooling. So, over time we settled on the root agent context file with some additional structure.
