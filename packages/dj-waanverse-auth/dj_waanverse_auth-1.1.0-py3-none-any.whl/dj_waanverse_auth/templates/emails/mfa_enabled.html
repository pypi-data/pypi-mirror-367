<p>Dear [User's Name],</p>

<p>We are excited to inform you that you have successfully enabled <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong> for your account. MFA adds an extra layer of security, helping to protect your account from unauthorized access.</p>

<h3>Here’s what you need to know:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Extra Security</strong><br />
        MFA requires a <strong>6-digit code</strong> generated by your registered authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) whenever you log in. This means that even if someone has your password, they won’t be able to access your account without the code.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>How MFA Works</strong><br />
        Every time you log in, you’ll be asked to enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app. This code refreshes every 30 seconds, so please make sure to open your app to get the latest code when logging in.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Disabling MFA</strong><br />
        If you decide that you no longer want MFA enabled, you can easily disable it at any time by logging into your account and visiting the <strong>settings page</strong>. Keep in mind that disabling MFA will remove this additional layer of protection from your account.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Recovery Options</strong><br />
        In case you lose access to your authenticator app (e.g., if you get a new phone), you can use <strong>recovery codes</strong> to regain access to your account. We strongly recommend storing your recovery codes in a safe place.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Important Note</strong><br />
        If you experience any issues with MFA or need assistance, please contact our support team. We are here to help you secure your account!
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for helping keep your account safe.</p>
