<h2 style="color: #333">Multi-Factor Authentication Disabled</h2>

<p>Dear,</p>

<p>We want to inform you that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has been successfully disabled for your account. Your account is no longer protected by MFA, and you can now log in using your password alone.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If you did not initiate this action, please reset your password immediately to secure your account.</li>
    <li>We strongly recommend re-enabling MFA to further protect your account. You can do so by visiting the account settings page and following the instructions provided.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact our support team at <a href="mailto:support@yourdomain.com" style="color: #007bff">support@yourdomain.com</a>.</p>
