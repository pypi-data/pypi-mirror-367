abstract = {Conventional approaches to analyzing the very large coherency strains that can occur during solid-state phase transformations are founded in linear elasticity and rely on infinitesimal strain metrics. Despite this, there are many technologically important examples where misfit strains of multi-phase mixtures are very large during their synthesis and/or application. In this paper, we present a framework for constructing strain-energy expressions and stress-strain relationships beyond the linear-elastic limit for crystalline solids. This approach utilizes group theoretical concepts to minimize both the number of free parameters in the strain-energy expression and amount of first-principles training data required to parameterize strain-energy models that are invariant to all crystal symmetries. Within this framework, the strain-energy and elastic stiffness can be described to high accuracy in terms of a set of conventional symmetry-adapted finite strain metrics that we define independent of crystal symmetry. As an illustration, we use first-principles electronic structure data to parameterize strain energy polynomials and employ them to explore the strain-energy surfaces of HCP Zr and Mg, as well as several important Zr-H and Mg-Nd phases that are known to precipitate coherently within the HCP matrices of Zr and Mg.}

	Abstract = {Measuring the similarity between two arbitrary crystal structures is a common challenge in crystallography and materials science. Although there are an infinite number of ways to mathematically relate two crystal structures, only a few are physically meaningful. Here we introduce both a geometry-based and a symmetry-adapted similarity metric to compare crystal structures. Using crystal symmetry and combinatorial optimization we describe an algorithm to arrive at the structural relationship that minimizes these similarity metrics across all possible maps between any pair of crystal structures. The approach makes it possible to (i) identify pairs of crystal structures that are identical, (ii) quantitatively measure the similarity between crystal structures, and (iii) find and rank structural transformation pathways between any pair of crystal structures. We discuss the advantages of using the symmetry-adapted cost metric over the geometric cost. Finally, we show that all known structural transformation pathways between common crystal structures are recovered with the mapping algorithm. The methodology presented in this study will be of value to efforts that seek to catalogue crystal structures, identify structural transformation pathways or prune large first-principles datasets used to parameterize on-lattice Hamiltonians.},
