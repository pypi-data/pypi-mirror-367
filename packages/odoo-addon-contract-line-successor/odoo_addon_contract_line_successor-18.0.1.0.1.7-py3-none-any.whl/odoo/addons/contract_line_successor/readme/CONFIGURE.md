- **Auto-Renewal Strategy**  
  In the company settings, define whether renewing a contract line:
  - Extends the current line (updates `date_end`),
  - or creates a new successor contract line.
  
  Field:  
  `Company > Configuration > Contracts > Create new contract line at renewal`
- **Scheduled Actions**  
  Ensure the scheduled action `Contract Line: Auto Renew` is activated if you
  want automatic renewal without manual intervention.
