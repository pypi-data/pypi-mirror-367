1. **Select a contract** and enable the option **"Recurrence at line level?"**.
2. Once enabled, you will have access to several actions at the contract line level:
   - **Stop** a contract line and optionally **plan a successor**.
   - **Handle temporary suspensions** and **resume** the contract line after the suspension period.
   - **Cancel** and **un-cancel** contract lines if necessary.
   - **Renew** contract lines either by **extending** the current line or by **creating a new successor line** automatically.
