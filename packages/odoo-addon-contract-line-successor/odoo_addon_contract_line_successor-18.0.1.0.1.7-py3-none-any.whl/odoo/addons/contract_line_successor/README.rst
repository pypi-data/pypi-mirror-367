| **Contract Line Successor** extends ``contract.line`` model to support
  advanced contract lifecycle management, including suspension,
  successor planning, cancellation, and renewal.
| It provides a flexible and robust framework for managing complex
  contract line scenarios in a clean and structured way.

Features
--------

- **Successor and Predecessor Management**

  - Link contract lines with successor and predecessor lines.
  - Plan successors automatically or manually after a stop or
    suspension.

- **Contract Line Lifecycle States**

  - Manage contract lines with the following computed states:

    - ``Upcoming``
    - ``In-Progress``
    - ``To Renew``
    - ``Upcoming Close``
    - ``Closed``
    - ``Canceled``

- **Lifecycle Operations**

  - Stop a contract line.
  - Plan a successor for a contract line.
  - Stop and plan a successor in one operation (useful for suspensions).
  - Cancel and un-cancel contract lines.
  - Renew contract lines automatically (new line or extension).

- **Auto-Renewal Handling**

  - Auto-renewal based on company settings (extend existing line or
    create a new one).
  - Cron job to automate renewal of eligible contract lines.

- **Data Integrity and Validation**

  - Prevent invalid successor or predecessor configurations.
  - Validate state transitions and date overlaps.
  - Ensure clean renewal and cancellation workflows.

- **Audit Trail**

  - Automatic posting of chatter messages for lifecycle events like
    stops, renewals, suspensions, cancellations, etc.

Configuration
=============

- | **Auto-Renewal Strategy**
  | In the company settings, define whether renewing a contract line:

  - Extends the current line (updates ``date_end``),
  - or creates a new successor contract line.

  | Field:
  | ``Company > Configuration > Contracts > Create new contract line at renewal``

- | **Scheduled Actions**
  | Ensure the scheduled action ``Contract Line: Auto Renew`` is
    activated if you want automatic renewal without manual intervention.

Usage
=====

1. **Select a contract** and enable the option **"Recurrence at line
   level?"**.
2. Once enabled, you will have access to several actions at the contract
   line level:

   - **Stop** a contract line and optionally **plan a successor**.
   - **Handle temporary suspensions** and **resume** the contract line
     after the suspension period.
   - **Cancel** and **un-cancel** contract lines if necessary.
   - **Renew** contract lines either by **extending** the current line
     or by **creating a new successor line** automatically.
