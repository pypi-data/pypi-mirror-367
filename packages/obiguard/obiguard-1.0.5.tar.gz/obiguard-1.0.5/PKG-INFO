# Obiguard Python SDK

## Security Control Panel for AI Apps

```bash
pip install obiguard
```

## Features

The Obiguard SDK is built on top of the OpenAI SDK, allowing you to seamlessly integrate Obiguard's advanced features while retaining full compatibility with OpenAI methods. With Obiguard, you can enhance your interactions with OpenAI or any other OpenAI-like provider by leveraging robust monitoring, reliability, prompt management, and more features - without modifying much of your existing code.

## Usage

#### Prerequisites
1. [Sign up on Obiguard](https://obiguard.ai/) and grab your Obiguard API Key
2. Add your [OpenAI key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to Obiguard's Virtual Keys page and keep it handy

```bash
# Installing the SDK
$ pip install obiguard
$ export OBIGUARD_API_KEY=<OBIGUARD API OR VIRTUAL KEY>
```

#### Making a Request to OpenAI
* Obiguard fully adheres to the OpenAI SDK signature. You can instantly switch to Obiguard and start using our production features right out of the box. <br />
* Just replace `from openai import OpenAI` with `from obiguard_ai import Obiguard`:

```py
from obiguard import Obiguard

obiguard = Obiguard(
    obiguard_api_key="OBIGUARD API OR VIRTUAL KEY"
)

chat_completion = obiguard.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test'}],
    model='gpt-4'
)

print(chat_completion)
```

#### Async Usage
* Use `AsyncObiguard` instead of `Obiguard` with `await`:

```py
import asyncio
from obiguard import AsyncObiguard

obiguard = AsyncObiguard(
    obiguard_api_key="OBIGUARD API OR VIRTUAL KEY",
)


async def main():
    chat_completion = await obiguard.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Say this is a test'}],
        model='gpt-4'
    )

    print(chat_completion)


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Compatibility with OpenAI SDK

Obiguard currently supports all the OpenAI methods, including the legacy ones.
