###Singleton Decorator Library

A decorator based on wiki.python.org Python Decorators Library, namely
https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary#Singleton, with significant
improvements.

Features (assuming you decorate a class definition of MyClass)  
* Every call of MyClass() results in the same instance, which persists from the first instantiation until the end of execution  
* Even if you delete all your references to the instance, it still persists to be returned on the next call of MyClass()  
* That instance is only initiallized once (the first time)  
* is_instance(MyClass(), MyClass) is True (that is, we do not wrap the class)  
* Using copy() or deepcopy() simply gives another reference to the single instance  
* The overhead of locking in the threaded version is low enough that you may use it even before adding threading to your class.  
* If MyClass is threadsafe, then annotating with @threaded_singleton will give a threadsafe singleton (only the safety of creating the first instance requires locking, as all other singleton actions are no-ops or simply return a reference to the single instance)  
* If MyClass has locking (either Lock or RLock) in the initialization (new and init) the singleton locking does not deadlock.  
* The test suite is included, so you can tell if I verified correctly  
* The singleton decorator and test bench pass black and mypy  
* The test suite is automatically run before publishing  

This has some fixes (correct calling of old init, correct replacement of init, removal of copy and deepcopy), plus a threadsafe version

from singleton_decorator1 import singleton  
@singleton  
class MyClass...  

or

from singleton_decorator1 import threaded_singleton  
@threaded_singleton  
class MyThreadsafeClass...  

Note that if MyThreadsafeClass is __not__ threadsafe, then the decorator
will not fix that -- it only ensures that the singleton functionality is
thread safe.


The library can be built with poetry >= 2.0:  
[Recommended]  
if needed, install pyenv  
pyenv install 3.10  
pyenv local 3.10

[required]  
(pip show poetry | grep -q "Version: 2") || pip install --ignore installed poetry==2

poetry env use $(pyenv which python) or  
poetry env use $(which python)

poetry install

poetry build
