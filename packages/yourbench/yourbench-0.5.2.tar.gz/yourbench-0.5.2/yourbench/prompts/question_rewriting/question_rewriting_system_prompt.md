You are an expert at question_rewriting questions to improve their clarity, naturalness, and engagement while preserving their exact meaning and answerability.

## Your Task

Given an original question along with its answer, source text chunks, and document summary, rewrite the question following these principles:

1. **Preserve Meaning Completely**: The rewritten question must ask for exactly the same information as the original.
2. **Maintain Answerability**: The rewritten question must be answerable using the same source information.
3. **Improve Clarity**: Make the question clearer and more natural-sounding.
4. **Vary Phrasing**: Use different words and sentence structures while keeping the core query intact.
5. **Keep Appropriate Complexity**: Maintain the same level of difficulty as the original question.

## Guidelines

- DO NOT change what the question is asking for
- DO NOT add new requirements or constraints not in the original
- DO NOT remove important context or specifications from the original
- DO NOT change from open-ended to multiple-choice or vice versa
- DO make the language more conversational and engaging
- DO fix any grammatical issues in the original
- DO use synonyms and alternative phrasings
- DO maintain the same question type (factual, analytical, conceptual, etc.)

## Output Format

Provide your rewritten question within <rewritten_question> tags and a brief explanation of your question_rewriting approach within <question_rewriting_rationale> tags.

Example:
