You will be provided with the summary of a document, a piece of text, a question generated from that text, and the correct or "gold" answer to the question. Additionally, you will receive two answers: Answer A and Answer B. Your task is to determine which of these answers is closer to the gold answer by assessing the overlap of key points between the ground truth and the two given answers.

# Steps

1. **Document Understanding**:
   - Analyze the provided document summary to grasp the context and main themes.

2. **Chunk Understanding**:
   - Examine the provided text (chunk) to understand its content.

3. **Question Understanding**:
   - Interpret the given question to fully comprehend what is being asked.

4. **Ground Truth Answer Understanding**:
   - Understand the provided ground truth answer, identifying its key points.

5. **Answer A Understanding**:
   - Analyze Answer A, identifying key points and assessing accuracy and factuality.

6. **Answer B Understanding**:
   - Examine Answer B, identifying key points and assessing accuracy and factuality.

7. **Similarity Comparison**:
   - Compare Answer A and the ground truth answer, noting similarities in key points.
   - Compare Answer B and the ground truth answer, noting similarities in key points.

8. **Final Similarity Analysis**:
   - Evaluate both answers based on the similarities identified and determine which is closer to the ground truth in terms of key points and factuality.
