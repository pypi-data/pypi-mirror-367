[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework to run hooks written in many languages, and it manages the language toolchain and dependencies for running the hooks.

`prefligit` is a reimagined version of pre-commit, built in Rust. It is designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative for it, while also providing some additional long-requested features.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in early stage of development, only a few of the original pre-commit features are implemented.
> It is not production-ready yet, but feel free to try it out and provide feedback.
>
> Current supported languages are `python`, `node`, `docker`, `docker-image`, `system`, `script` and `fail`.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was previously named `pre-commit-rs`, but it was renamed to `prefligit` to prevent confusion with the existing pre-commit tool.
> See [#73](https://github.com/j178/prefligit/issues/73) for more information.

## Features

- üöÄ A single binary with no dependencies, does not require Python or any other runtime.
- ‚ö°  About [10x faster](https://github.com/j178/prefligit/blob/master/BENCHMARK.md) and uses roughly 2/3 less disk space than `pre-commit`.
- üîÑ Fully compatible with the original pre-commit configurations and hooks.
- üêç Integration with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies.
- üõ†Ô∏è Improved toolchain installations for Python, Node.js, Go, Rust and Ruby, shared between hooks.
- üì¶ Built-in implementation of some common hooks.
- üèóÔ∏è (TODO) Built-in support for monorepos.

## Usage

```console
$ prefligit run
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
fix end of files.........................................................Passed
typos....................................................................Passed
cargo fmt................................................................Passed
cargo clippy.............................................................Passed
```

`prefligit` is designed to be a drop-in alternative for the original `pre-commit` tool, so you can use it with your existing configurations and hooks.

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://pre-commit.com/) for more information on how to configure and use pre-commit.

## Acknowledgements

This project is heavily inspired by the original [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, and it wouldn't be possible without the hard work
of the maintainers and contributors of that project.

And a special thanks to the [Astral](https://github.com/astral-sh) team for their remarkable projects, particularly [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
from which I've learned a lot on how to write efficient and idiomatic Rust code.
