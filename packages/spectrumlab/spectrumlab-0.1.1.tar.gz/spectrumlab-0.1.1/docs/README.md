# SpectrumLab Documentation

Welcome to the SpectrumLab documentation! This guide will help you contribute to our documentation system.

## About This Documentation

This documentation is built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), a static site generator designed for creating fast, beautiful documentation websites. Our documentation supports both English and Chinese languages to serve our global community.

## Contributing to the Documentation

Contributing to our documentation is straightforward! Simply clone the project, add or modify Markdown files, commit your changes, and create a Pull Request.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/little1d/SpectrumLab.git
cd SpectrumLab
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the docs directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd docs
npm install
```

Alternatively, if you prefer using the development dependencies globally:

```bash
npm add -D vitepress
npm install
```

### Step 3: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your documentation changes. We recommend using the naming convention `docs/<section-name>` (e.g., `docs/api`, `docs/examples`, `docs/benchmarks`).

```bash
git checkout -b docs/<your-section-name>
```

For detailed branching and contribution guidelines, please refer to our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/little1d/SpectrumLab/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Step 4: Preview Your Changes

#### Local Development

To start the development server and preview your changes in real-time:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

This will start a local server (typically at `http://localhost:5173`) where you can preview your documentation changes.

#### Production Build

If you need to test the complete compilation and packaging:

```bash
# Build the documentation
npm run docs:build

# Preview the production build
npm run docs:preview
```

> **Note:** These commands are configured in `docs/package.json`. You can modify them if needed.

### Step 5: Deployment

We have automated deployment set up using GitHub Actions. The deployment process is triggered automatically when:

- Changes are pushed to the `main` branch
- Changes are made to files in the `docs/` directory
- Changes are made to the deployment workflow file

**All you need to do is create a Pull Request!** Once your PR is merged into the main branch, the documentation will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.
