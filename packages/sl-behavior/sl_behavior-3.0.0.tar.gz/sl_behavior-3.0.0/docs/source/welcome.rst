Welcome to sl-behavior API documentation page
=============================================

sl-behavior is a Python library that provides tools for processing non-visual behavior scientific data acquired in the
`Sun (NeuroAI) lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ at Cornell University.

This library is designed to extract and process the data stored in .npz log files generated by the sl-experiment
library. As part of its runtime, it generates a set of .feather files that stores the extracted and processed data until
it is integrated in an analysis dataset.

This website only contains the API documentation for the classes and methods offered by this library. See the project
GitHub repository for installation instructions and library usage examples:
