# slurm_top_python

`slurm_top_python` is a task manager for high-performance computing systems that use Slurm. It was originally designed for the UCSD Expanse servers, but can work on other servers that use Slurm and Slurm jobs.

Credit to [ptop](https://github.com/darxtrix/ptop) - original creators of the Python taskmanager app that this is based on. You can view the licensing under the LICENSE file. This app is an adaptation of their program.

## Work in progress

## Installation

`slurm_top_python` is compatible with both Python2.x and Python3.x and is tested on Linux environments.

```bash
pip install slurm_top_python
```

or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kinetekenergy/slurm_top_python
cd slurm_top_python/
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Upgrading slurm_top_python

```bash
pip install --upgrade slurm_top_python
```

## Usage

```bash
slurm_top_python
```

Alternatively, you can type `s_top`.

## Common Errors

When running the program, you might get the following error: `(<class 'npyscreen.wgwidget.NotEnoughSpaceForWidget'>, NotEnoughSpaceForWidget('Not enough space for requested size'), <traceback object at 0x155552ca4e00>)`.

This means that your terminal size isn't big enough. To fix this, make your terminal window larger. You can maximize it or manually make it larger.

## Developing slurm_top_python

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kinetekenergy/slurm_top_python
code slurm_top_python # vscode is preferred, but any IDE that supports docker + devcontainers will work
```

Open the devcontainer in your IDE. If you are using vscode, there will be a pop-up asking to reopen the folder in a devcontainer. Accept it, and all the necessary tools will be installed.


**Note:** slurm_top_python will create a log file called `.slurm_top_python.log` in the home directory of the user.

## Main modules

- `slurm_top_python.core` : Defines a basic `Plugin` class that other plugins in the `slurm_top_python.plugins` inherit.
- `slurm_top_python.interfaces` : The interface to the slurm_top_python built using npyscreen.
- `slurm_top_python.plugins` : This module contains all the plugin sensors supported i.e `Disk Sensor`,`Memory Sensor`,`Process Sensor`, etc. ( Any new plugin should be added here).
- `slurm_top_python.statistics` : Generate continuous statistics using background thread jobs by locating plugins in the plugins directory.
- `slurm_top_python.utils` : Custom thread classes.

## Publishing

**First time:**

```bash
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
# enter your api key when prompted
```

**To update:**

First, update your version number. Then:

```bash
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/<the .whl file that was generated>
# enter your api key when prompted
```
