management, global chat, matchmaking, and more.

Typical usage example:

    client = Client()
    client.auth.login(...)

    Unified client for interacting with MafiaOnline services.

    Provides a single entry point exposing submodules for authentication,
    user management, players, global chat, rooms, matchmaking, HTTPS proxying,
    and lowâ€‘level Mafia API calls. Delegates method access to the appropriate
    submodule when attributes are looked up.

    Attributes:
        auth (Auth): Authentication submodule for login and token management.
        sub_modules (dict[str, Any]): Mapping of submodule names to instances,
            used to delegate attribute access dynamically.
