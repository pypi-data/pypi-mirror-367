The library features the "Neural" model, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. It supports both CPU and GPU, providing excellent performance for large networks. You can also export and import Deep models and continue training on other machines. The exported file is generated in the ".brain" format, which is a proprietary data type of this project. For more information, please visit our repository.
