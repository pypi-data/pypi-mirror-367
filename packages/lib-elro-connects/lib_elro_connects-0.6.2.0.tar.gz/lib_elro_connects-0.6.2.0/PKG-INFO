![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/lib-elro-connects.svg)

**NOTE**

This project is suppose to provide an API for the Elro connects K1 adapter.
Thare is a Elro Connects K2 adapter, but is not supported with this library.

The code idea is based on the the code of Bas van den Berg https://github.com/dib0/elro_connects.

Aim of this library is to provide a API for the Elro Connects P1 connector. Example code is included.

The code requires Python 3.9 or higher.

A PyPi package wil become available. To be installed with:
`pip install lib-elro-connects`

Kind regards,

Jan Bouwhuis
