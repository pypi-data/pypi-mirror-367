# foldindent - indented text viewer with folding

`foldindent` is a terminal user interface (TUI) for viewing indented text files with the possibility to fold parts based on indentation.
`foldindent` can view arbitrary text files.

`foldindent` can be seen as pager dedicated to indented text data.

Each time lines are more indented than previous lines, a foldable point is added in the UI.
