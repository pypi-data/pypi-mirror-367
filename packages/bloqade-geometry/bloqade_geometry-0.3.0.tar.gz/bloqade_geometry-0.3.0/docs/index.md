# Welcome to Bloqade-Geometry

Bloqade-Geometry is a collection of tools for transforming and modeling geometric
objects used for defining layouts and operation of neutral atom quantum computers.

Currently the only supported geometry is a grid, but more geometries will be added in
the future. For a full list of features, see the [API Reference](reference/bloqade/geometry/prelude/).

## Installation

```bash
uv add bloqade-geometry
```

See [Installation](install.md) for more details.
