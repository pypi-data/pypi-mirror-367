Author: Kevin Zhu, with code that may be from others (credit given).

This is a library with solutions of LeetCode everyday that is updated as quickly as possible. If I am unable to create a solution, it may not be there.

If you have a solution or would like to contribute a different one email me at kzhu2099@gmail.com. If I use yours, I will make sure to give credit!!

It has been stopped as of August 1, 2025, but may continue in the future.

## Features

- a (hopefully) long list of (hopefully) unique LeetCode Solutions
- ability to contribute

## Installation

To install `kzleet`, use pip: ```pip install kzleet```.

However, many prefer to use a virtual environment.

macOS / Linux:

```sh
# make your desired directory
mkdir /path/to/your/directory
cd /path/to/your/directory

# setup the .venv (or whatever you want to name it)
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv

# install kzleet
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install kzleet

deactivate # when you are completely done
```

Windows CMD:

```sh
# make your desired directory
mkdir C:path\to\your\directory
cd C:path\to\your\directory

# setup the .venv (or whatever you want to name it)
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv

# install kzleet
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install kzleet

deactivate # when you are completely done
```

## Usage

You may look at the problems by importing like so:

`from kzleet import Solution_####` where `####` is the problem number of the problem. They are also sorted by the LeetCode given difficulty in different files.

There may be multiple implementations: just add a letter after (`_A, _B`) for different ones.

Then, to see the code, simply run `print(Solution_####())`.

This works for both classes and functions, allowing you to see the full solution.

For solutions that have multiple steps, there may be an internal comment (visible within the print) with those extra helper functions.

## Disclaimer

This library provides personal / community solutions from LeetCode.
They are not the Editorial solutions that you find there, and are in no means as good as theirs.
This is for educational purposes to provide a different perspective on problems.
also, I will try my best to answer all problems. If I can't, I may ask AI (due to not having time) or it having a significantly improved solution. I will always write if it uses AI.
