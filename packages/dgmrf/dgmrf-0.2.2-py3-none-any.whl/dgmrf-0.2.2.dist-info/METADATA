Deep Gaussian Markov Random Fields and their extensions.

We use JAX for very fast computations. Check out the various notebooks to see what the library offers.

Non-official reimplementations of the following models (work in progress, not everything is included in the library yet):

# Installation

Install the latest version with pip

```bash
pip install dgmrf
```

Note that it may be simpler to install jax GPU version with torch CPU only version

# Documentation

The project's documentation is available at [https://hgangloff.gitlab.io/dmgrf/index.html](https://hgangloff.gitlab.io/dgmrf/)

# Contributing

* First fork the library on Gitlab.

* Then clone and install the library in development mode with

```bash
pip install -e .
```

* Install pre-commit and run it.

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

* Open a merge request once you are done with your changes.
