# Chawk 

**This project is a work in progress.**<br>
A python wrapper of the blackboard api to simplify admin tasks such as managing courses and users.  


# Setup 
You can request access to the Blackboard REST APIs through the [Developer Portal](https://developer.blackboard.com/). You will need to create an application to get the needed keys. 


# Example of using the library 
```python

from bbpy.blackboard_client import BlackboardClient


base_url = "https://blackboard.xxxx.edu"
client_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
client_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Create client
client = BlackboardClient(client_id, client_secret, base_url, "example.log")

# Example usage
print(client.user.does_user_exist("00000_0"))
print(client.courses.does_course_exist("00000_1"))

client.courses.enroll_user("dg123", "math101213", "Student")
```
