User Privacy Settings
=====================

The User Privacy Settings page contains options for if you are operating your
system in a jurisdiction where you are required to (or want to) provide privacy
information and customization to your users. This contains several settings:

* **Terms of service URL:**
    If present, a link to the terms of service will be included on the
    :guilabel:`My Account` page, as well as on the login and registration
    pages.

    This defaults to empty (disabled).

* **Privacy policy URL:**
    If present, a link to your privacy policy will be included on the
    :guilabel:`My Account` page, as well as on the login and registration
    pages.

    This defaults to empty (disabled).

* **Privacy information:**
    This field allows you to enter HTML-formatted text to be displayed to users
    on their :guilabel:`My Account` -> :guilabel:`Your Privacy` page.

    This defaults to empty (disabled).

* **Require consent for usage of personal information:**
    In jurisdictions and situations where EU GPDR (or similar) compliance is
    required, enabling this will require that users grant permission for the
    use of their personal data, including names and e-mail addresses. If this
    is disabled, that data may be visible in Review Board or sent to
    third-party services (such as avatar providers) by default.

    This defaults to being disabled.
