.. _installation-linux:

============================
Manually Installing on Linux
============================

.. tip::

   We recommend installing Review Board using the :ref:`Review Board
   Installer <installation-installer>`.

   This will handle installation for a wide range of Linux distributions,
   and is the easiest way to install Review Board.

   The instructions below are for historical purposes, and for administrators
   and Linux distro packagers looking for more information on the install
   process.

Review Board is most commonly used on Linux, and supports the latest versions
of most major Linux distributions.

In this guide, we'll show you how to install Review Board yourself on Linux.
This will require a compatible version of Python, and several system packages.

If you're looking for a different solution, you may consider:

* :ref:`Deploying using Docker <installation-docker>`
* `Hosting with us on RBCommons <RBCommons_>`_

If you need any assistance, `reach out to us for support <support_>`_.

.. _support: https://www.reviewboard.org/support/


Compatibility
=============


.. _supported-python:

Python
------

Review Board |version| supports Python |python_min_version| or higher.

If your Linux distribution does not come with a supported version of Python,
you may need to upgrade or look into a solution like :ref:`Docker
<installation-docker>`.

Alternatively, you can compile your own Python, along with mod_wsgi or
another server. This is only recommended if you're comfortable with this
process.


.. _supported-linux-distros:

Linux Distributions

Preparing For Installation
==========================

Administrator Access
--------------------

This guide covers the following administrative actions:

* **Installing system packages.**

  This will use :command:`yum` for Red Hat-based distributions, and
  :command:`apt-get` for Debian-based distributions.

* **Creating system directories.**

  For example, :file:`/opt/reviewboard` for a Python Virtual Environment and
  :file:`/var/www/reviews.example.com` for a Review Board site directory.

This will typically require you to be a superuser (``root``).

We recommend switching to ``root`` before you begin the steps below:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo -s


.. _installation-python-virtualenv:

Python Virtual Environments vs. System Installs
-----------------------------------------------

A Python Virtual Environment is a self-contained copy of Python and a set of
packages. This is supported by Review Board, and comes with some advantages:

* **Isolation from system packages.**

  System upgrades won't break your Virtual Environment's packages, and
  Virtual Environment upgrades won't break your system.

* **Easier system migration and backups.**

  You can easily snapshot your entire environment and move or copy it between
  servers.

* **They're easy to set up and use.**

  These are not Virtual Machines or Docker images. They're just directories
  created on your system using a tool provided by your Linux distribution.

We recommend Virtual Environments for Review Board 5.0.5 and higher.

If you're working with an earlier install of Review Board, you have a **System
Install**.

Instructions are provided on each step for both Virtual Environments and
System Installs.

.. important::

   If you're using Ubuntu 23.04+, Fedora 38+, or another Linux distribution
   released after 2022, it may require you to use Virtual Environments.

   This is due to a Python standard called `PEP 668`_, which disables system
   installs of software like Review Board. If you see an error about
   "externally managed environments" when using :command:`pip`, this is the
   cause.

   If you're upgrading your Linux system to these releases, you will need to:

   1. Follow this guide to create a new Virtual Environment for Review Board.
   2. Either upgrade to Review Board 5.0.5+ or perform some manual changes to
      your web server to activate your Virtual Environment.

   `Contact support <support_>`_ for assistance in migrating your legacy
   install into a Virtual Environment.


.. _PEP 668: https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/


.. _linux-http-proxy:

Using a HTTP(S) Proxy
---------------------

If you're behind a proxy server, you'll need to set the :envvar:`http_proxy`
environment variable to your proxy server before running :command:`pip`. This
must be done as the user running :command:`pip`, in the same shell.

To enable a proxy:

.. code-block:: console

    $ export http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com/
    $ export https_proxy=https://proxy.example.com/


Let's Begin
===========

1. Install System Packages
--------------------------

You will need to install a handful of packages before installing Review Board:

.. tabs::

   .. code-tab:: console Debian/Ubuntu

      $ apt-get install build-essential libffi-dev libjpeg-dev libssl-dev \
                        libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libxmlsec1-openssl patch \
                        python3-dev python3-pip python3-virtualenv

   .. code-tab:: console RHEL/Fedora/CentOS

      $ yum install gcc libffi-devel libtool-ltdl-devel libxml2-devel \
                    openssl-devel patch perl python3-devel \
                    python3-virtualenv xmlsec1-devel xmlsec1-openssl-devel


2. Create a Virtual Environment
-------------------------------

If you're installing using a :ref:`Python Virtual Environment
<installation-python-virtualenv>` instead of a System Install, you'll need
to create your environment:

.. code-block:: console

   $ virtualenv /opt/reviewboard

.. tip::

   This will use the default version of Python on your system.

   If you want to use a specific version of Python that you have installed,
   you can pass :option:`-p <pythonX.Y>`.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ virtualenv -p python3.11 /opt/reviewboard

   This version **must** be supported by your web server!

.. important::

   Use :command:`virtualenv`, not :command:`python -m venv`.

   If you're familiar with Python already, you may be used to using
   :command:`python -m venv`, but this isn't suitable for Review Board. There
   are small differences in the virtual environment that will cause problems
   with activating the environment within the web server.


3. Install Review Board
-----------------------

To install Review Board and its required dependencies in one go:

.. tabs::

   .. code-tab:: console Python Virtual Environments

      $ /opt/reviewboard/bin/pip install ReviewBoard

   .. code-tab:: console System Installs

      $ pip3 install ReviewBoard


This will automatically download and install the latest stable release of
Review Board and the required versions of its core dependencies.

If you need to install a specific version:

.. tabs::

   .. code-tab:: console Python Virtual Environments

      $ /opt/reviewboard/bin/pip install ReviewBoard==<version>

      # For example:
      $ /opt/reviewboard/bin/pip install ReviewBoard==5.0.6

   .. code-tab:: console System Installs

      $ pip3 install ReviewBoard==<version>

      # For example:
      $ pip3 install ReviewBoard==5.0.3


4. Install Power Pack for Review Board (optional)
-------------------------------------------------

`Power Pack`_ is an optional licensed extension to Review Board. It adds
several additional features to Review Board that are useful to businesses and
enterprises, including:

2. Install the Python support in your environment.

   .. warning::

      You may have trouble installing some versions of mysqlclient_,
      depending on your Linux distribution.

      mysqlclient_ 2.2 supports MySQL 8.0.33+, but is incompatible with many
      Linux distributions (including Amazon Linux and Debian).

      We recommend trying to install the latest version. If that doesn't
      work, try installing 2.1.1. If you need help, `reach out to us for
      support <support_>`_.

      See the `mysqlclient documentation`_ and `bug tracker
      <mysqlclient-bug-tracker>`_ for more information.
