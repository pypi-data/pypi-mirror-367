Replying to Comments
====================

All reviews (including comments on code and file attachments) are shown on the
review request page in individual review boxes. Discussion about a particular
review will take place solely within that review box.

To reply to a comment in a review, click the :guilabel:`Reply` button below the
comment. You can type your comment and then press :guilabel:`Save` to save, or
:guilabel:`Cancel` to discard the comment.

You can also reply to the review as a whole by clicking :guilabel:`Reply` under
the review header. If there is no header text, click :guilabel:`Comment` at the
top of the review.

You can use rich text in your replies using the :term:`Markdown` language. See
:ref:`using-markdown` for more information.

Unpublished comments (as indicated by your name in green) will appear only to
you. When you have a draft reply, it will be visible in the :ref:`review banner
<review-banner>`.

To publish your replies, click :guilabel:`Publish` in the banner. If you have
multiple drafts, you can publish only a single reply by selecting it in the
mode selector at the top left of the review banner.

Depending on the server setup, replying to a review may send out an e-mail to
all people involved in that review. This is displayed as part of a threaded
discussion in the e-mail clients. Because of this, you must publish replies on
a per-review basis. It's like replying to separate e-mail threads in a mail
client.
