Review Board 3.0.22 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: May 4, 2021


Packaging
=========

* Removed the dependency on :pypi:`bleach-allowlist` introduced in
  :doc:`3.0.21 <3.0.21>`.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed regressions with some Markdown features.

  The security fix in :doc:`3.0.21 <3.0.21>` regressed some Markdown features,
  namely code block styling, emojis, and tables, due to the tags or attributes
  being used for those features being incorrectly seen as unsafe.

  This release restores support for these Markdown features.
