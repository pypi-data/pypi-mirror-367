Review Board 4.0.2 Release Notes
================================

**Release date**: June 15, 2021


Security Fixes
==============

This release fixes a XSS vulnerability in the Markdown Review UI, which could
allow an attacker to upload a Markdown document containing links that
execute arbitrary JavaScript when clicked in the rendered view.

The attacker would need to be someone who already has legitimate access to
your server and can post Markdown documents for review.

We recommend that everyone (especially those running public servers) upgrades
to address this vulnerability, though the seriousness of the issue will vary
from company to company.


New Features
============

* Added support for custom URL protocols in Markdown-rendered HTML.

  The recent changes to sanitize Markdown rendering removed the ability to
  use any arbitrary protocol in a URL (such as ones that would open links in
  an installed app).

  Administrators can now define protocols that are considered safe in
  :file:`settings_local.py`. For example:

  .. code-block:: python

      ALLOWED_MARKDOWN_URL_PROTOCOLS = ['gopher', 'ftp', 'eclipse']


Performance Improvements
========================

* Sped up some database queries used when performing access control checks
  for review requests.


Bug Fixes
=========

Authentication
--------------

* Session and CSRF cookies are now properly set as "Secure" when Review Board
  is configured for HTTPS.

  This avoids warnings and future behavioral changes in browsers.


GitLab
------

* Fixed a crash when configuring GitLab repositories. (:bug:`4928`)


Markdown
--------

* Fixed a crash that could occur with some invalid characters in e-mail
  addresses.


Subversion
----------

* Files represented in diffs with a ``(nonexistent)`` revision are now treated
  as deleted.
