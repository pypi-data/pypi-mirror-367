New Features
============

* The New Review Request page now supports large numbers of repositories.

  Only 25 repositories are now shown when first loading the page. Users can
  search for the repository they want through the :guilabel:`Filter` input,
  and matching repositories will be loaded from the server.

  This will help with performance and usability on servers, particularly with
  hundreds or thousands of repositories.


Bug Fixes
=========

Authentication
--------------

* Fixed a Python 3 compatibility issue when generating data to send to
  Googleâ€™s reCAPTCHA service.


Text Fields
-----------

* Fixed rendering problems with inline and fenced code blocks in Markdown
  text fields.

  This eliminates some rare visual jumps when editing text, problems with the
  cursor when wrapping inline code, slight borders within inline code, and
  styling around some types of fenced code blocks.

* Fixed visual jumps due to sub-pixel rendering issues with review request
  text fields.

  Some fields in the review request page were offset by fractions of a pixel.
  This could cause them to appear to jump, depending on the screen DPI, zoom
  level, and browser.


Diff Viewer
-----------

* Fixed a crash that could occur when computing indentation changes for
  interdiffs (:bug:`4969`).

* Fixed expanding lines of code when viewing certain ranges of commits.


Review Requests
---------------

* Diff previews on comments are no longer cached if they show an error.

  If encountering a temporary issue communicating with a repository, the diff
  preview shown above a comment would show the error message. This was getting
  cached by the browser, causing users to see the error even after the issue
  was resolved.

* Headers shown above a group of fields are no longer shown if there are no
  fields to show.

  Previously, if an extension provided a group of fields with a header above
  it, that header was always shown even if the fields were not.

  This was encountered with the :rbintegration:`Cliosoft SOS <cliosoft-sos>`
  support in `Power Pack`_ 5.

* Fixed a rare race condition where two conflicting pending reviews or replies
  can be created at once.

  When a server is under heavy load, or a user is encountering network
  slowdown (such as when working from home with an Internet connection
  experiencing problems), it's possible for a person to trigger two operations
  for a review that the server will try to handle at once. This can result in
  two reviews or two replies being made, which will conflict with each other.

  Review Board now detects this case and will resolve the conflicts, merging
  the two copies together.

* Fixed a rare race condition where two review requests with the same Perforce
  change number can be created at once.

  This is similar to the above issue with reviews and replies. Under certain
  conditions, Review Board may receive and process two requests to create a
  review request with the same change number. This is now detected and
  resolved automatically.


GitLab
------

* Fixed compatibility with fetching diffs from GitLab.

  GitLab recently phased out an API that's needed by the New Review Request
  page. This API returns a diff for a commit.

  We now support fetching diffs by making use of alternative GitLab APIs.
  Please note that, unfortunately, this process is much slower and can impact
  your GitLab API rate limit.

  We recommend using RBTools_ to post changes for review instead of the New
  Review Request page. RBTools is unaffected by the performance problems of
  the new GitLab APIs.

Legacy ClearCase
----------------

.. note::

   The ClearCase support in Review Board is considered legacy and **will not**
   be receiving any feature updates.

   For modern support, please switch to the modern IBM ClearCase/HCL
   VersionVault support in `Power Pack`_.

* Fixed a number of issues with parsing diffs.


Extensions
----------

* Fixed an extension initialization and state ordering bug.

  The ``extension_cls.instance`` attribute was being set too late, preventing
  it from being used in some extension-provided setup code (such as any code
  registering objects for the administration UI).
