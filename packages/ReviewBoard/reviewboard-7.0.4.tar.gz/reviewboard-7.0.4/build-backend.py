"""Python build backend for Review Board.

This is a specialization of the setuptools build backend, making the following
custom changes:

1. Including all of Review Board's dependencies as build-time dependencies.

   We execute code within Review Board as part of the build process, meaning
   that we need most (if not all) of the dependencies at build time. To play
   it safe, we simply include them all.

2. Introspecting reviewboard/dependencies.py for package metadata.

   Setuptools allows for dynamic dependencies, but only when including it
   via a requirements.txt-formatted file. We temporarily generate one of those
   for Setuptools when building the metadata.

   (Note that we have no other place to inject this, as pyproject.toml's
   dependencies, even if empty/not specified, override anything we could set
   anywhere else.)

3. Building media and i18n files.

   When building wheels or source distributions, we run our media-building
   scripts, ensuring they get included in the resulting files.

Version Added:
    7.1


Editable Installs
-----------------

By default, this build backend will pull down the latest versions of Djblets
and any other build related dependencies in order to build the package. This
is the case whether you're building a package or setting up an editable
install (:command:`pip install -e .`).

If you need to set up an editable install against in-development builds of
Djblets, Django-Pipeline, or other packages, you will need to set up symlinks
to your local packages in :file:`.local-packages/`. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd .local-packages
   $ ln -s ~/src/djblets djblets

This must match the package name as listed in the dependencies (but is
case-insensitive).


Static Media
------------

As part of packaging or setting up editable installs, this build backend will
regenerate static media files. As part of this process, it will set up symlinks
to the applicable source trees in :file:`.npm-workspaces/`.

If you are building a package out of your tree, any existing symlinks in
this directory may be overridden, pointing to packages in the temporary build
environment. Editable installs should exhibit this issue.

When you're building packages, always do so from a clean clone of the tree.
