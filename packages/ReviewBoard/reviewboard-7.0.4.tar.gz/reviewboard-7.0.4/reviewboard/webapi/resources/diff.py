        A parent diff can be uploaded along with the main diff. A parent diff
        is a diff based on an existing commit in the repository, which will

        parent branch would be provided along with the diff of the new commit,
        and only the new commit will be shown.

        :mimetype:`multipart/form-data` mimetype. The main diff's name and
        content would be stored in the ``path`` field. If a parent diff is
        provided, its name and content would be stored in the
        ``parent_diff_path`` field.
