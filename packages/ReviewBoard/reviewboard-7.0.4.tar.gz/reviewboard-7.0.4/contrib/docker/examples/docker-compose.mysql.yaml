# Example docker-compose configuration for Review Board on MySQL.
#
# Please note, this file is meant to be used as an example! You will need
# to change some settings first. See the instructions.
#
#
# Instructions
# ============
#
# 1. Copy the following to a new directory:
#
#    * docker-compose.yaml (based on this file)
#    * nginx_templates
#
# 2. Change the hostname below to a fully-qualified domain name you'll be
#    able to use for the server. Search for "localhost" for the default.
#
#    See DOMAIN and NGINX_HOST below.
#
#    To temporarily test a hostname, you can modify /etc/hosts on Linux
#    or macOS and alias it to your IP address.
#
#    NOTE: If you change this later, you will need to edit the sitedir
#          volume's conf/settings_local.py to include the new hostname in
#          ALLOWED_HOSTS, and change the hostname in Review Board's
#          Admin UI -> General Settings page.
#
# 3. Change the database passwords below to something secure.
#
#    See MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_PASSWORD, and DATABASE_PASSWORD.
#
# 4. Change the company name for your server.
#
#    See COMPANY below.
#
# 5. Go through this file and search for "CHANGEME" for other settings you
#    may want to change.
#
# 6. Run: docker-compose up
#
# 7. Access http://<hostname>/
#
#
# Data Storage
# ============
#
# This example configuration will create two directories for storage:
#
# db_data/
#     The MySQL database contents.
#
#     This CANNOT be shared across multiple MySQL database servers.
#
# sitedir/
#     Review Board site directory content (static media files, data, and
#     configuration).
#
#     This CAN be shared across multiple Review Board server instances, and
#     Nginx instances.
#
#
# Production Use
# ==============
#
# As this is only a sample configuration, you'll likely want to make other
# changes for production use, such as:
#
# 1. Setting up a load balancer with SSL enabled.
#
# 2. Separating out the database and memcached server for other Review Board
#    instances to use.
#
# 3. Making sure only port 80 is accessible on the network.
#
# These are all beyond the scope of this example configuration.
#
# You should also go through this file, read the comments, and change any
# configuration needed for your install.
