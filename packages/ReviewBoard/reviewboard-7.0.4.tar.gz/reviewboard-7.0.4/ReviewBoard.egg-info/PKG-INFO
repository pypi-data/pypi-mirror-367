Review Board
============

|release-badge| |license-badge| |reviewed-with-badge| |python-badge|


`Review Board`_ is an open source, web-based code and document review tool
built to help companies, open source projects, and other organizations keep
their quality high and their bug count low.

We began writing Review Board in 2006 to fill a hole in the code review market.
We wanted something open source that could be flexible enough to work with a
variety of workflows, and could take the pain out of the code review process.

Today, it's a vital part of the development process at thousands of projects
and companies, ranging from small startups of two people to enterprises of
thousands.

What does Review Board do?
--------------------------

Review Board tracks changes to your pending code, graphics, documents, and all
discussions around all the decisions made about your product. Our diff viewer
does more than just display diffs: It shows you exactly how your code was
changed, with syntax highlighting, interdiffs, moved line detection,
indentation change indicators, and more.

You can integrate with Review Board using its rich API and extension
frameworks, allowing custom features, review UIs, data analysis, and more to be
built without ever having to fork Review Board.

There's support for Bazaar, ClearCase, CVS, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, Plastic,
and Team Foundation Server, hosted on your own server or on Assembla,
Beanstalk, Bitbucket, Codebase, GitHub, GitLab, Gitorious, Kiln, or Unfuddle.

Getting Support
---------------

We can help you get going with Review Board, and diagnose any issues that may
come up. There are two levels of support: Public community support, and private
premium support.

The public community support is available on our main `discussion list`_. We
generally respond to requests within a couple of days. This support works well
for general, non-urgent questions that don't need to expose confidential
information.

We can also provide more
`dedicated, private support <https://www.beanbaginc.com/support/contracts/>`_
for your organization through a support contract. We offer same-day responses
(generally within a few hours, if not sooner), confidential communications,
installation/upgrade assistance, emergency database repair, phone/chat (by
appointment), priority fixes for urgent bugs, and backports of urgent fixes to
older releases (when possible).
