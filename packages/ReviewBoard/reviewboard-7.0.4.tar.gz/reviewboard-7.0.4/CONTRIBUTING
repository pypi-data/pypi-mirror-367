If you're looking to contribute to Review Board, we've written up a handy
little guide that will be useful to you:

http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/codebase/dev/contributing-patches/

Please note that we do *not* accept pull requests! Instead, every patch must
go through a code review process on our own Review Board server at
http://reviews.reviewboard.org/.

Also, bonus points for unit tests.
