        repository (reviewboard.scmtools.models.Repository):
            The repository the diff is being posted against.

        basedir (unicode):
            The base directory to prepend to all file paths in the diff.

        base_commit_id (unicode):
            The ID of the commit that the diff is based upon. This is

            files, if the diffs represent blob IDs instead of commit IDs
            and the service doesn't support those lookups.

        diffset (reviewboard.diffviewer.models.diffset.DiffSet):

            Whether to just validate and not save. If ``True``, then this
            won't populate the database at all and will return ``None``
