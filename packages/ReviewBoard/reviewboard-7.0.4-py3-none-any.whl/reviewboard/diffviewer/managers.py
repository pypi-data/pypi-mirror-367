            commit_message (unicode):
                The commit message.

            author_name (unicode):
                The author's name.

            author_email (unicode):
                The author's e-mail address.

            author_date (datetime.datetime):
                The date and time that the commit was authored.

            request (django.http.HttpRequest, optional):
                The HTTP request from the client.

                ValidateDiffCommitResource`.

            base_commit_id (unicode, optional):
                The ID of the commit that the diff is based upon. This is
                needed by some SCMs or hosting services to properly look up
                files, if the diffs represent blob IDs instead of commit IDs
                and the service doesn't support those lookups.

            check_existence (bool, optional):
                Whether or not existence checks should be performed against
                the upstream repository.

            validate_only (bool, optional):
