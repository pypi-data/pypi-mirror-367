> [!NOTE]
> Try asking the model to give you some markdown-formatted text, like:
>
> `Give me a markdown-formatted text about the history of AI.`

So try it out and see how it works!

## Installation

### Install using package manager (recommended)

#### Debian/Ubuntu Installation

1. Add the PPA to your sources list:

   ```bash
   echo 'deb [trusted=yes] https://packages.qincai.xyz/debian stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qincai-ppa.list
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install mdllama:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-mdllama
   ```

#### Fedora Installation

1. Download the latest RPM from:
   [https://packages.qincai.xyz/fedora/](https://packages.qincai.xyz/fedora/)

   Or, to install directly:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install https://packages.qincai.xyz/fedora/mdllama-<version>.noarch.rpm
   ```

   Replace `<version>` with the latest version number.

2. (Optional, highly recommended) To enable as a repository for updates, create `/etc/yum.repos.d/qincai-ppa.repo`:

   ```ini
   [qincai-ppa]
   name=Raymont's Personal RPMs
   baseurl=https://packages.qincai.xyz/fedora/
   enabled=1
   metadata_expire=0
   gpgcheck=0
   ```

   Then install with:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install mdllama
   ```

3, Install the `ollama` library from pip:

   ```bash
   pip install ollama
   ```

   You can also install it globally with:

   ```bash
   sudo pip install ollama
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `ollama` library is not installed by default in the RPM package since there is no system `ollama` package avaliable (`python3-ollama`). You need to install it manually using pip in order to use `mdllama` with Ollama models.
