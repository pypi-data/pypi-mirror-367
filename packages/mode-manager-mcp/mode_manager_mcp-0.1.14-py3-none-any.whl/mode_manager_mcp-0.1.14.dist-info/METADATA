# GitHub Copilot Memory Tool

**Finally, Copilot that actually remembers you.**

Perfect timing for 2025: VS Code now loads instructions with every message. This tool gives Copilot **persistent memory** across all your conversations.

*If you are missing `python` or `pipx` you better [do this first!](#get-it-running-2-minutes)*

## Why This Matters Now

**2025 Game Changer**: VS Code's new behavior loads custom instructions with **every chat request** (not just session start). This means:

- **Your memories are ALWAYS active** in every conversation  
- **No more repeating context** when you start new chats
- **Copilot truly knows you** across sessions, topics, and projects
- **Perfect timing** - built for the new instruction loading behavior

## See It In Action

**Before this tool:**
> *"Hey Copilot, write me a Python function..."*  
> Copilot: *Gives generic Python code*

**After using `remember`:**
> You: *"Remember I'm a senior data architect at Oatly, prefer type hints, and use Black formatting"*  
> Next conversation: *"Write me a Python function..."*  
> Copilot: *Generates perfectly styled code with type hints, following your exact preferences*

## Dead Simple to Use

**One command does everything:**

```
Ask Copilot: "Remember that I prefer detailed docstrings and use pytest for testing"
```

That's it. Copilot now knows this **forever**, across all future conversations.

### What You Can Remember:
- **Work context** - Your role, company, current projects
- **Coding preferences** - Languages, frameworks, style guides  
- **Project details** - Architecture decisions, naming conventions
- **Personal workflow** - How you like to work, debug, test

## How It Works Behind the Scenes

1. **Auto-setup** - Creates `memory.instructions.md` in your VS Code prompts directory on first use
2. **Smart storage** - Each memory gets timestamped and organized  
3. **Always loaded** - VS Code's 2025 behavior means your memories are included in every chat request
4. **Cross-session persistence** - Your memories survive VS Code restarts and new conversations

## Bonus Features

Beyond memory, this tool also manages your VS Code prompt ecosystem:
- **Curated library** - 20+ professional chatmodes and instructions  
- **File management** - Create, edit, and organize `.chatmode.md` and `.instructions.md` files
- **Stay updated** - Update files from source while keeping your customizations

## Get It Running (2 Minutes)

*If you don't even have `python`, you need to install that first. You can get it at [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)*

### 1. Install pipx from PyPI
```bash
pip install pipx
```
### 2. Click on the badge for your VS Code

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=modemanager&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22pipx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22mode-manager-mcp%22%5D%7D)
[![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=modemanager&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22pipx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22mode-manager-mcp%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)

### .. Or manually add it to your VS Code
Add this to your VS Code MCP settings (`mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "mode-manager": {
      "command": "pipx",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "mode-manager-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

That's it! Start chatting with Copilot and use: *"Remember that..."*

### Bonus ..

As a convenience, you can run the following prompt in VS Code to get started in the best way:

```
/mcp.mode-manager.onboarding
```

This will guide you through the onboarding process, set up your persistent memory, and ensure Copilot knows your preferences from the start.

## Perfect Timing for 2025

This tool is built specifically for VS Code's new behavior where **custom instructions load with every chat message**. This makes persistent memory incredibly powerful - your memories are always active, no matter what topic you're discussing.
