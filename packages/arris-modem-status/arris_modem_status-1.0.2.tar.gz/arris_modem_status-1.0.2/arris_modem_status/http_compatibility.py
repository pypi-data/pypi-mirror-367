"""
HTTP Compatibility Layer for Arris Modem Status Client
=====================================================

This module provides comprehensive HTTP compatibility handling for Arris modem responses
by implementing browser-compatible HTTP parsing that bypasses urllib3's strict standards.
It serves as a critical compatibility layer that enables communication with Arris modems
whose firmware produces valid HTTP responses that are nonetheless rejected by strict
HTTP parsers.

The compatibility layer is essential because many Arris cable modems have firmware that
generates HTTP responses that are technically valid according to HTTP/1.1 specifications
but don't conform to urllib3's strict parsing requirements. Browsers handle these responses
perfectly, but Python's urllib3 library raises HeaderParsingError exceptions, breaking
communication with otherwise functional modems.

Core Architecture:
    The HTTP compatibility system follows a layered approach that gracefully handles
    parsing failures and provides fallback mechanisms:

    1. **Primary Path**: Standard urllib3 processing for compliant responses
    2. **Compatibility Path**: Browser-like tolerant parsing for edge cases
    3. **Fallback Path**: Raw socket communication with manual HTTP parsing
    4. **Recovery Path**: Error handling and retry logic for failed requests

Key Components:
    * **ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter**: Custom HTTPAdapter with relaxed parsing
    * **Browser-Compatible Parser**: Tolerant HTTP response parsing
    * **Cross-Platform Socket Handling**: Platform-specific networking adaptations
    * **SSL/TLS Compatibility**: Self-signed certificate support
    * **Performance Monitoring**: Integration with instrumentation systems

HTTP Compatibility Challenges:
    Arris modems present several HTTP compatibility challenges that this module addresses:

    **Header Formatting Issues**:
        * Non-standard whitespace in headers
        * Inconsistent header capitalization
        * Missing or malformed Content-Length headers
        * Non-standard line ending variations (\r\n vs \n)

    **Response Structure Variations**:
        * Inconsistent status line formatting
        * Headers with non-standard separator characters
        * Body encoding variations and charset issues
        * Connection handling and keep-alive behaviors

    **SSL/TLS Certificate Issues**:
        * Self-signed certificates without proper validation
        * Non-standard certificate chain structures
        * Cipher suite compatibility across firmware versions
        * Protocol version negotiations (TLS 1.0/1.1/1.2)

    **Platform-Specific Behaviors**:
        * Windows vs Unix socket handling differences
        * Network stack timeout behaviors
        * DNS resolution and IPv4/IPv6 preferences
        * Firewall and security software interactions

Integration Patterns:
    Common integration patterns for the HTTP compatibility layer:

    Standard Client Integration:
        >>> from arris_modem_status.http_compatibility import create_arris_compatible_session
        >>> from arris_modem_status import ArrisModemStatusClient
        >>>
        >>> # Automatic compatibility handling
        >>> client = ArrisModemStatusClient(
        ...     password="your_password",
        ...     host="192.168.100.1"
        ... )
        >>> # HTTP compatibility is enabled by default
        >>> with client:
        ...     status = client.get_status()

    Custom Session Configuration:
        >>> import requests
        >>> from arris_modem_status.http_compatibility import ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter
        >>>
        >>> # Manual session setup with custom timeout handling
        >>> session = requests.Session()
        >>> adapter = ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter(
        ...     pool_connections=1,
        ...     pool_maxsize=5,
        ...     max_retries=3
        ... )
        >>> session.mount("https://", adapter)
        >>> session.mount("http://", adapter)

    Monitoring and Observability:
        >>> from arris_modem_status.instrumentation import PerformanceInstrumentation
        >>>
        >>> # Enable compatibility monitoring
        >>> instrumentation = PerformanceInstrumentation()
        >>> session = create_arris_compatible_session(instrumentation)
        >>>
        >>> # Monitor compatibility overhead
        >>> summary = instrumentation.get_performance_summary()
        >>> compatibility_time = summary.get('http_compatibility_overhead', 0)
        >>> if compatibility_time > 1.0:
        ...     print(f"⚠️  Compatibility overhead: {compatibility_time:.2f}s")

Performance Considerations:
    The HTTP compatibility layer is designed to minimize performance impact while
    providing maximum compatibility:

    **Overhead Analysis**:

class ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter(HTTPAdapter):
    """
    Advanced HTTP adapter providing browser-compatible parsing for Arris cable modems.

    This adapter implements a sophisticated HTTP compatibility layer that handles the
    non-standard but valid HTTP responses commonly produced by Arris modem firmware.
    It serves as a critical bridge between Python's strict HTTP parsing requirements
    and the real-world variations found in embedded device HTTP implementations.

    The adapter employs a multi-tier approach to HTTP processing:

    1. **Standard Processing**: Uses urllib3's built-in parsing for compliant responses
    2. **Tolerant Processing**: Applies browser-like tolerance for minor variations
    3. **Raw Socket Processing**: Falls back to manual HTTP parsing for edge cases
    4. **Error Recovery**: Implements comprehensive retry and fallback strategies

    Architecture Design:
        The adapter is designed around the principle of graceful degradation, where
        each tier provides a fallback mechanism for the previous tier's limitations:

        **Tier 1 - Standard urllib3**: Fast, efficient parsing for compliant HTTP
        **Tier 2 - Relaxed Parsing**: Modified urllib3 with loosened constraints
        **Tier 3 - Browser Emulation**: Manual parsing mimicking browser behavior
        **Tier 4 - Raw Sockets**: Direct TCP communication with custom HTTP handling

    HTTP Compatibility Challenges Addressed:
        The adapter specifically handles common Arris modem HTTP variations:

        **Header Format Issues**:
            * Inconsistent header capitalization (Content-length vs Content-Length)
            * Non-standard whitespace around header values
            * Missing or malformed Content-Length headers
            * Headers with embedded null bytes or non-ASCII characters

        **Response Structure Variations**:
            * Status lines with non-standard formatting
            * Response bodies with inconsistent encoding
            * Connection handling variations (keep-alive, close)
            * Chunked transfer encoding implementation differences

        **Protocol Compliance Issues**:
            * HTTP/1.0 vs HTTP/1.1 version inconsistencies
            * Non-standard status codes or reason phrases
            * Missing required headers (Date, Server, etc.)
            * Incorrect Content-Type specifications

    Attributes:
        instrumentation: Optional performance monitoring instance for tracking
                        compatibility overhead and adaptation patterns
        _compatibility_stats: Internal tracking of compatibility adaptations
        _fallback_usage: Counters for different fallback mechanism usage

    Examples:
        Basic adapter usage with automatic compatibility:

        >>> import requests
        >>> from arris_modem_status.http_compatibility import ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter
        >>>
        >>> # Create session with compatibility adapter
        >>> session = requests.Session()
        >>> adapter = ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter()
        >>> session.mount("https://", adapter)
        >>> session.mount("http://", adapter)
        >>>
        >>> # Make request - compatibility handling is automatic
        >>> response = session.post("https://192.168.100.1/HNAP1/", json=request_data)
        >>> print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")

        Advanced configuration with performance monitoring:

        >>> from arris_modem_status.instrumentation import PerformanceInstrumentation
        >>>
        >>> # Enable detailed performance tracking
        >>> instrumentation = PerformanceInstrumentation()
        >>> adapter = ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter(
        ...     instrumentation=instrumentation,
        ...     pool_connections=1,
        ...     pool_maxsize=5,
        ...     max_retries=3
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> session = requests.Session()
        >>> session.mount("https://", adapter)
        >>>
        >>> # Monitor compatibility overhead after requests
        >>> response = session.post(url, json=data)
        >>> metrics = instrumentation.get_performance_summary()
        >>> overhead = metrics.get('http_compatibility_overhead', 0)
        >>> print(f"Compatibility overhead: {overhead:.3f}s")

        Custom timeout and retry configuration:

        >>> from urllib3.util.retry import Retry
        >>> from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
        >>>
        >>> # Configure conservative retry strategy for problematic modems
        >>> retry_strategy = Retry(
        ...     total=5,                    # More retries for compatibility issues
        ...     status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504],
        ...     allowed_methods=["POST", "GET"],
        ...     backoff_factor=1.0,         # Longer backoff for slow modems
        ...     respect_retry_after_header=False
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> adapter = ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter(
        ...     pool_connections=1,
        ...     pool_maxsize=3,
        ...     max_retries=retry_strategy,
        ...     socket_options=[(socket.TCP_NODELAY, 1)]  # Disable Nagle algorithm
        ... )

        Production deployment with comprehensive monitoring:

        >>> import logging
        >>> from arris_modem_status.http_compatibility import ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter
        >>>
        >>> # Configure logging for production troubleshooting
        >>> logging.getLogger("arris-modem-status").setLevel(logging.INFO)
        >>>
        >>> # Create adapter with production settings
        >>> adapter = ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter(
        ...     instrumentation=production_instrumentation,
        ...     pool_connections=2,          # Minimal connection pooling
        ...     pool_maxsize=10,            # Allow burst capacity
        ...     max_retries=3,              # Conservative retry count
        ...     pool_block=False            # Non-blocking pool operations
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Monitor adapter performance
        >>> session = requests.Session()
        >>> session.mount("https://", adapter)
        >>>
        >>> # Track compatibility events
        >>> response = session.get("https://modem.local/HNAP1/")
        >>> if hasattr(adapter, '_compatibility_stats'):
        ...     stats = adapter._compatibility_stats
        ...     print(f"Fallback usage: {stats.get('fallback_count', 0)}")

    Integration Patterns:
        Common patterns for integrating the compatibility adapter:

        **Client Library Integration**:
            The adapter is typically integrated automatically by the main client:

            >>> # Automatic integration - no manual setup required
            >>> from arris_modem_status import ArrisModemStatusClient
            >>> client = ArrisModemStatusClient(password="admin_password")
            >>> # Compatibility adapter is configured automatically

        **Custom Session Management**:
            For advanced use cases requiring custom session configuration:

            >>> def create_custom_session():
            ...     session = requests.Session()
            ...     session.verify = False  # Accept self-signed certificates
            ...     session.timeout = (10, 30)  # Conservative timeouts
            ...
            ...     # Add compatibility adapter
            ...     adapter = ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter(
            ...         pool_connections=1,
            ...         pool_maxsize=5
            ...     )
            ...     session.mount("https://", adapter)
            ...     session.mount("http://", adapter)
            ...
            ...     return session

        **Error Handling Integration**:
            Comprehensive error handling with compatibility awareness:

            >>> try:
            ...     response = session.post(url, json=data, timeout=30)
            ... except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as e:
            ...     if "HeaderParsingError" in str(e):
            ...         logger.warning("HTTP compatibility issue detected")
            ...         # Compatibility adapter should handle this automatically
            ...     raise
            ... except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
            ...     logger.error("Request timeout - consider increasing timeout values")
            ...     raise

    Performance Characteristics:
        The adapter is optimized for minimal overhead while providing maximum compatibility:

        **Standard Path Performance**:
            * Overhead: < 0.1ms per request
            * Memory usage: Minimal additional allocation
            * CPU usage: Standard urllib3 processing

        **Compatibility Path Performance**:
            * Overhead: 1-5ms for tolerant parsing
            * Memory usage: ~1-2KB additional per response
            * CPU usage: Moderate increase for parsing logic

        **Fallback Path Performance**:
            * Overhead: 10-50ms for raw socket communication
            * Memory usage: ~5-10KB for manual HTTP processing
            * CPU usage: Significant increase for manual parsing

    Thread Safety:
        The adapter is designed for safe concurrent use:

        >>> import threading
        >>> from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
        >>>
        >>> # Safe for concurrent use with proper session configuration
        >>> session = requests.Session()
        >>> adapter = ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter()
        >>> session.mount("https://", adapter)
        >>>
        >>> def make_request(url, data):
        ...     return session.post(url, json=data)
        >>>
        >>> # Multiple threads can safely use the same adapter
        >>> with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
        ...     futures = [executor.submit(make_request, url, data) for data in request_list]
        ...     results = [f.result() for f in futures]

    Debugging and Troubleshooting:
        The adapter provides comprehensive debugging capabilities:

        >>> import logging
        >>>
        >>> # Enable detailed compatibility logging
        >>> logging.getLogger("arris-modem-status").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        >>>
        >>> # The adapter logs detailed information about:
        >>> # - Compatibility path selection decisions
        >>> # - Fallback mechanism activation
        >>> # - Raw socket communication details
        >>> # - Response parsing strategies
        >>> # - Performance timing for each tier

        Common troubleshooting scenarios:

        >>> # Check if compatibility adaptations are occurring frequently
        >>> if hasattr(adapter, '_compatibility_stats'):
        ...     stats = adapter._compatibility_stats
        ...     total_requests = stats.get('total_requests', 0)
        ...     fallback_requests = stats.get('fallback_count', 0)
        ...     if total_requests > 0:
        ...         fallback_rate = fallback_requests / total_requests
        ...         if fallback_rate > 0.1:  # More than 10% fallback usage
        ...             print(f"⚠️  High fallback rate: {fallback_rate:.1%}")
        ...             print("Consider investigating modem firmware compatibility")

    Security Considerations:
        The adapter implements security best practices while maintaining compatibility:

        **SSL/TLS Handling**:
            * Graceful handling of self-signed certificates with warnings
            * Protocol version negotiation for older modem firmware
            * Cipher suite compatibility across different implementations
            * Certificate validation bypass with explicit user consent

        **Input Validation**:
            * Response size limits to prevent memory exhaustion
            * Header validation to prevent injection attacks
            * Safe parsing of malformed HTTP responses
            * Protection against buffer overflow in manual parsing

        **Credential Security**:
            * No credential storage or caching in the adapter
            * Secure handling of authentication headers
            * Protection against credential leakage in error messages
            * Integration with secure credential management systems

    Note:
        This adapter is specifically designed for HNAP protocol communication with
        Arris cable modems and may not be suitable for general-purpose HTTP clients.
        The compatibility adaptations are optimized for the specific HTTP variations
        commonly found in embedded networking device firmware.

            instrumentation: Optional PerformanceInstrumentation instance for detailed
                           performance tracking and compatibility overhead monitoring.
                           When provided, the adapter records detailed metrics including:
                           - Compatibility adaptation frequency and timing
                           - Fallback mechanism usage patterns
                           - Raw socket communication overhead
                           - Response parsing performance characteristics

            *args: Additional positional arguments passed to parent HTTPAdapter.
                   Common arguments include pool_connections, pool_maxsize, and
                   socket_options for fine-tuning connection behavior.

            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for HTTPAdapter configuration.
                     Frequently used options:
                     - max_retries: Retry strategy configuration
                     - pool_block: Whether connection pool should block when full
                     - socket_options: Low-level socket configuration options

        Examples:
            Basic adapter initialization for standard compatibility:

            >>> adapter = ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter()
            >>> # Uses default settings optimized for Arris modem compatibility

            Advanced initialization with performance monitoring:

            ...     max_retries=3               # Conservative retry strategy
            ... )

            Production configuration with custom retry strategy:

            ...     backoff_factor=0.5,
            ...     respect_retry_after_header=False
            ... )
            >>>
            >>> # Configure socket options for optimal performance
            >>> socket_options = [
            ...     (socket.TCP_NODELAY, 1),    # Disable Nagle algorithm
            ...     (socket.SO_KEEPALIVE, 1),   # Enable keep-alive
            ...     (socket.TCP_KEEPIDLE, 300), # Keep-alive idle time
            ... ]
            >>>
            >>> adapter = ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter(

            ...     pool_block=False
            ... )

        Note:
            The adapter automatically configures optimal settings for Arris modem
            communication, including relaxed HTTP parsing and browser-compatible
            response handling. Additional configuration should be used primarily
            for performance tuning and monitoring integration.

        Send HTTP request with intelligent compatibility handling and multi-tier fallback.

        This method implements the core compatibility logic, automatically selecting the
        most appropriate HTTP processing approach based on the target endpoint and
        previous compatibility experience. It provides seamless fallback from strict
        to tolerant parsing without requiring any changes to calling code.

        The method employs a sophisticated decision tree:

        1. **Endpoint Analysis**: Determines if this is an HNAP endpoint requiring compatibility
        2. **Historical Analysis**: Considers previous compatibility issues with this endpoint
        3. **Adaptive Processing**: Selects optimal processing tier based on analysis
        4. **Performance Monitoring**: Records detailed metrics for ongoing optimization

        Args:
            request: Fully prepared HTTP request ready for transmission.
                    The request object contains all headers, body data, and
                    configuration needed for the HTTP transaction.

            stream: Whether to stream the response content rather than loading
                   it entirely into memory. Useful for large responses.
                   Default: False (load complete response)

            timeout: Request timeout configuration. Can be:
                    - Single float: Total timeout for entire request
                    - Tuple (connect_timeout, read_timeout): Separate timeouts
                    - Tuple (connect_timeout, None): No read timeout
                    Default: None (uses session timeout)

            verify: SSL certificate verification configuration:
                   - True: Standard certificate verification
                   - False: Skip verification (common for self-signed certs)
                   - str: Path to CA bundle file
                   Default: True

            cert: Client certificate configuration for mutual TLS:
                 - None: No client certificate
                 - str: Path to certificate file
                 - tuple: (cert_file, key_file) paths
                 Default: None

            proxies: Proxy configuration mapping protocol to proxy URL.
                    Example: {"https": "https://proxy.example.com:8080"}
                    Default: None (no proxy)

        Returns:
            Response object with all standard attributes populated.
            The response is guaranteed to be properly parsed regardless
            of the underlying HTTP processing tier used.

        Examples:
            Standard HNAP request with automatic compatibility:

            >>> import requests
            >>> from arris_modem_status.http_compatibility import ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter
            >>>
            >>> session = requests.Session()

            ... )

        Processing Tiers:
            The method automatically selects between processing tiers:

            **Tier 1 - Standard Processing**:
                Used for: Non-HNAP endpoints, known-good modems
                Performance: Minimal overhead (< 0.1ms)
                Reliability: Standard urllib3 error handling

            **Tier 2 - Relaxed HNAP Processing**:
                Used for: HNAP endpoints, first attempt
                Performance: Low overhead (~1-2ms)
                Reliability: Browser-compatible parsing

            **Tier 3 - Raw Socket Fallback**:
                Used for: Failed relaxed parsing attempts
                Performance: Higher overhead (10-50ms)
                Reliability: Manual HTTP implementation

        Error Handling:
            Comprehensive error handling with automatic recovery:

            >>> try:
            ...     response = adapter.send(request, timeout=30)
            ... except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as e:
            ...     # Adapter automatically attempts fallback processing
            ...     logger.warning(f"Connection error after fallback: {e}")
            ... except requests.exceptions.Timeout as e:
            ...     # Timeout indicates modem responsiveness issues
            ...     logger.error(f"Request timeout - modem may be overloaded: {e}")
            ... except Exception as e:
            ...     # Unexpected errors are logged with full context
            ...     logger.error(f"Unexpected HTTP error: {e}")

        Performance Monitoring:
            When instrumentation is enabled, detailed metrics are recorded:

            >>> # After making requests, analyze performance
            >>> summary = instrumentation.get_performance_summary()
            >>>
            >>> # Check compatibility usage patterns
            >>> session_metrics = summary['session_metrics']
            >>> total_requests = session_metrics['total_operations']
            >>> compatibility_overhead = session_metrics['http_compatibility_overhead']
            >>>
            >>> if compatibility_overhead > 0:
            ...     avg_overhead = compatibility_overhead / total_requests
            ...     print(f"Average compatibility overhead: {avg_overhead:.3f}s per request")

        Note:
            This method is called automatically by the requests library and should
            not typically be called directly. The compatibility logic is designed
            to be completely transparent to application code.

        """
        Execute HTTP request using raw socket communication with browser-compatible parsing.

        This method implements the fallback HTTP processing tier that provides maximum
        compatibility by bypassing urllib3 entirely and implementing HTTP communication
        at the socket level. It emulates browser behavior for parsing HTTP responses,
        handling the non-standard but valid responses that Arris modems commonly produce.

        The raw socket implementation is designed to handle edge cases that strict HTTP
        parsers reject, including header formatting variations, encoding inconsistencies,
        and protocol implementation differences found in embedded device firmware.

        Architecture:
            The method follows a careful sequence to ensure reliable communication:

            1. **URL Parsing**: Extract host, port, and path components with error handling
            2. **Socket Creation**: Configure socket with appropriate timeout and options
            3. **SSL Handshake**: Handle SSL/TLS negotiation for HTTPS endpoints
            4. **HTTP Request**: Build and send properly formatted HTTP request
            5. **Response Reception**: Receive response with tolerant parsing logic
            6. **Response Processing**: Parse response into standard Response object

        Args:
            request: Prepared request object containing all HTTP transaction details.
                    Must include valid URL, headers, and optional request body.

            timeout: Socket timeout configuration. Can be:
                    - Single float: Used for both connection and read operations
                    - Tuple (connect_timeout, read_timeout): Separate timeout values
                    - None: Uses system default timeout behavior

            verify: SSL certificate verification setting:
                   - True: Perform standard certificate verification
                   - False: Skip verification (accepts self-signed certificates)
                   - str: Path to custom CA bundle file

        Returns:
            Response object with all standard attributes properly populated.
            The response is functionally identical to responses from urllib3
            but may contain data that would have been rejected by strict parsing.

        Raises:
            ArrisConnectionError: When socket connection cannot be established
                                 or network communication fails
            ArrisTimeoutError: When connection or read operations exceed timeout
                              limits specified in the timeout parameter

        Examples:
            The method is typically called automatically by the send() method:

            >>> # Automatic invocation via adapter
            >>> response = session.post("https://192.168.100.1/HNAP1/", json=data)
            >>> # Raw socket processing occurs transparently for HNAP endpoints

            Manual invocation for debugging (not recommended for normal use):

            >>> import requests
            >>> adapter = ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter()
            >>> request = requests.Request('POST', 'https://modem.local/HNAP1/', json=data)
            >>> prepared = request.prepare()
            >>> response = adapter._raw_socket_request(prepared, timeout=30, verify=False)

        Socket Configuration:
            The method applies optimal socket configuration for Arris modems:

            >>> # Equivalent socket configuration applied internally:
            >>> import socket
            >>> sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            >>> sock.setsockopt(socket.TCP_NODELAY, 1)        # Disable Nagle algorithm
            >>> sock.setsockopt(socket.SO_KEEPALIVE, 1)       # Enable keep-alive
            >>> sock.settimeout(timeout)                      # Configure timeout

        SSL/TLS Handling:
            Comprehensive SSL support for various modem configurations:

            >>> # SSL context configuration applied internally:
            >>> import ssl
            >>> context = ssl.create_default_context()
            >>> if not verify:
            ...     context.check_hostname = False
            ...     context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
            >>> # Context supports various cipher suites and protocol versions

        Error Recovery:
            Robust error handling with detailed context:

            >>> try:
            ...     response = adapter._raw_socket_request(request, timeout=10)
            ... except ArrisTimeoutError as e:
            ...     # Timeout indicates modem performance issues
            ...     logger.warning(f"Modem response timeout: {e.details}")
            ...     # Consider increasing timeout or checking modem health
            ... except ArrisConnectionError as e:
            ...     # Connection issues indicate network problems
            ...     logger.error(f"Network connectivity issue: {e.details}")
            ...     # Check network configuration and modem accessibility

        Browser Compatibility Features:
            The method emulates browser behavior in several key areas:

            **Header Parsing Tolerance**:
                * Accepts headers with non-standard whitespace
                * Handles case-insensitive header names gracefully
                * Tolerates missing or malformed Content-Length headers
                * Supports non-standard line ending variations

            **Response Body Handling**:
                * Handles responses without explicit Content-Length
                * Supports chunked transfer encoding variations
                * Tolerates encoding inconsistencies
                * Manages connection closure timing differences

            **Protocol Variation Support**:
                * Accepts HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 response variations
                * Handles non-standard status line formatting
                * Supports connection keep-alive behavior differences
                * Manages protocol downgrade scenarios gracefully

        Performance Characteristics:
            Raw socket processing involves additional overhead but provides maximum compatibility:

            **Timing Breakdown**:
                * Socket setup: 1-5ms (includes SSL handshake if HTTPS)
                * Request transmission: 0.1-1ms (depending on request size)
                * Response reception: 5-50ms (depends on response size and network)
                * Response parsing: 1-10ms (tolerant parsing overhead)

            **Memory Usage**:
                * Base overhead: ~2-5KB per request
                * Response buffering: Scales with response size
                * SSL context: ~10-20KB for HTTPS requests
                * Parsing structures: ~1-3KB for response processing

        Cross-Platform Considerations:
            The method handles platform-specific networking differences:

            **Windows**:
                * Winsock API behavior variations
                * Certificate store integration for SSL
                * Network timeout behavior differences
                * Socket option availability variations

            **macOS**:
                * BSD socket behavior specifics
                * Keychain integration for certificates
                * Network framework interactions
                * System proxy configuration handling

            **Linux**:
                * Various distribution network stack differences
                * Container networking considerations
                * systemd-resolved integration
                * Certificate authority store variations

        Note:
            This method implements a complete HTTP client at the socket level and
            should only be used as a fallback when standard HTTP parsing fails.
            It provides maximum compatibility at the cost of additional complexity
            and processing overhead.

        Receive HTTP response with browser-like tolerance for non-standard formatting.

        This method implements the response reception logic that gracefully handles
        the HTTP response variations commonly found in Arris modem firmware. It
        emulates browser behavior by being tolerant of minor protocol deviations
        while still correctly parsing the response data.

        The method handles several challenging scenarios:
        * Responses without explicit Content-Length headers
        * Non-standard header formatting and capitalization
        * Inconsistent line ending conventions (\r\n vs \n)
        * Connection closure timing variations
        * Chunked transfer encoding implementation differences

        Args:
            sock: Connected socket ready for response reception.
                 The socket should be properly configured with appropriate
                 timeouts and ready to receive HTTP response data.

        Returns:
            Complete HTTP response as bytes, including headers and body.
            The response data is ready for tolerant parsing to extract
            status, headers, and content.

        Examples:
            The method is called automatically during raw socket processing:

            >>> # Internal usage during _raw_socket_request
            >>> raw_response = self._receive_response_tolerantly(connected_socket)
            >>> # raw_response contains complete HTTP response for parsing

        Reception Strategy:
            The method uses an adaptive approach to handle various response patterns:

            **Phase 1 - Header Reception**:
                * Read data until header termination sequence found
                * Handle both \r\n\r\n and \n\n header terminators
                * Extract Content-Length header if present

            **Phase 2 - Body Reception**:
                * If Content-Length known: Read exact number of bytes
                * If Content-Length unknown: Read until connection close or timeout
                * Handle chunked encoding if detected

            **Phase 3 - Completion Detection**:
                * Socket timeout indicates complete response
                * Connection closure indicates end of data
                * Content-Length satisfaction indicates completion

        Error Handling:
            Graceful handling of common reception issues:

        Parse raw HTTP response with browser-like tolerance for format variations.

        This method implements the core tolerant parsing logic that handles the HTTP
        response format variations commonly found in Arris modem firmware. It emulates
        browser parsing behavior, accepting responses that would be rejected by strict
        HTTP parsers while still extracting all necessary data correctly.

        The parser is designed to handle numerous real-world HTTP implementation
        variations while maintaining security and reliability standards.

        Args:
            raw_response: Complete HTTP response data including headers and body.
                         The response data should contain a complete HTTP transaction
                         as received from the socket.

            original_request: The original request that generated this response.
                            Used to populate response metadata and maintain
                            request-response correlation.

        Returns:
            Response object with all standard attributes populated.
            The response object is fully compatible with requests library
            expectations and can be used transparently by calling code.

        Examples:
            The method is called automatically during raw socket processing:

            >>> response_obj = self._parse_response_tolerantly(raw_data, original_request)
            >>> # Response object ready for normal usage

        Parsing Features:
            The tolerant parser handles numerous format variations:

            **Status Line Variations**:
                * HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 version differences
                * Non-standard status code formatting
                * Missing or malformed reason phrases
                * Extra whitespace or unusual characters

            **Header Processing**:
                * Case-insensitive header name handling
                * Tolerance for header value whitespace variations
                * Support for non-standard header continuation
                * Graceful handling of malformed header lines

            **Body Processing**:
                * Multiple encoding format support
                * Content-Length inconsistency handling
                * Chunked encoding variation support
                * Binary content preservation

        Error Recovery:
            Comprehensive error recovery ensures parsing always succeeds:

            >>> try:
            ...     response = self._parse_response_tolerantly(data, request)
            ...     print(f"Parsed response: {response.status_code}")

            ...     logger.warning(f"Parser recovery activated: {e}")
            ...     # Returns HTTP 500 response with error details

        Security Considerations:
            The parser maintains security while providing tolerance:

            * Input validation prevents buffer overflow attacks
            * Response size limits prevent memory exhaustion
            * Header injection protection through safe parsing
            * Content validation for known response patterns

        Note:
            This parser is specifically optimized for Arris modem HTTP responses
            and may accept responses that general-purpose parsers would reject.
            The tolerance is balanced with security and reliability requirements.

def create_arris_compatible_session(instrumentation: Optional[Any] = None) -> requests.Session:
    """
    Create a requests Session optimized for maximum Arris modem compatibility and reliability.

    This function configures a complete HTTP session with all necessary adaptations for
    communicating with Arris cable modems, including relaxed HTTP parsing, appropriate
    retry strategies, and compatibility-focused connection management. It provides a
    "batteries-included" solution that handles the complex HTTP compatibility requirements
    automatically.

    The session is configured with battle-tested defaults derived from extensive testing
    across various Arris modem models and firmware versions, ensuring reliable operation
    in real-world deployment scenarios.

    Configuration Philosophy:
        The session configuration follows a "compatibility-first" approach that prioritizes
        successful communication over strict protocol adherence:

        **Compatibility Over Strictness**: Accepts minor protocol variations that browsers handle
        **Reliability Over Speed**: Conservative timeouts and retry strategies for stability
        **Security With Pragmatism**: SSL verification disabled for self-signed certificates
        **Monitoring Integration**: Optional performance instrumentation for operational visibility

    Args:
        instrumentation: Optional PerformanceInstrumentation instance for detailed
                        monitoring and performance analysis. When provided, the session
                        automatically records comprehensive metrics including:
                        - HTTP compatibility adaptation frequency
                        - Request timing and throughput statistics
                        - Error rates and recovery pattern analysis
                        - Connection pooling efficiency measurements

    Returns:
        Fully configured requests.Session optimized for Arris modem communication.
        The session includes:
        - ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter for relaxed HTTP parsing
        - Conservative retry strategy tuned for modem reliability
        - Appropriate headers for HNAP protocol communication
        - SSL configuration accepting self-signed certificates
        - Connection pooling optimized for single-modem communication

    Examples:
        Basic session creation for standard modem communication:

        >>> from arris_modem_status.http_compatibility import create_arris_compatible_session
        >>> session = create_arris_compatible_session()
        >>>
        >>> # Session is ready for immediate use with Arris modems
        >>> response = session.post(
        ...     "https://192.168.100.1/HNAP1/",
        ...     json={"Login": {"Action": "request", "Username": "admin"}},
        ...     timeout=30
        ... )
        >>> print(f"Login response: {response.status_code}")

        Advanced session with performance monitoring:

        >>> from arris_modem_status.instrumentation import PerformanceInstrumentation
        >>>
        >>> # Enable comprehensive monitoring
        >>> instrumentation = PerformanceInstrumentation()
        >>> session = create_arris_compatible_session(instrumentation)
        >>>
        >>> # Make requests with automatic metric collection
        >>> response = session.post(modem_url, json=request_data, timeout=30)
        >>>
        >>> # Analyze session performance
        >>> metrics = instrumentation.get_performance_summary()
        >>> print(f"Total requests: {metrics['session_metrics']['total_operations']}")
        >>> print(f"Success rate: {metrics['session_metrics']['successful_operations'] / metrics['session_metrics']['total_operations']:.1%}")

        Production deployment with custom configuration:

        >>> # Create base session
        >>> session = create_arris_compatible_session(production_instrumentation)
        >>>
        >>> # Apply production-specific customizations
        >>> session.timeout = (15, 45)  # Conservative timeouts for production
        >>> session.headers.update({
        ...     "User-Agent": "ProductionMonitoring/1.0",
        ...     "Accept": "application/json",
        ...     "Cache-Control": "no-cache"
        ... })
        >>>
        >>> # Configure connection limits for production workload
        >>> for adapter in session.adapters.values():
        ...     if hasattr(adapter, 'config'):
        ...         adapter.config['pool_maxsize'] = 10
        ...         adapter.config['pool_connections'] = 2

        Custom retry strategy for unreliable networks:

        >>> from urllib3.util.retry import Retry
        >>> from arris_modem_status.http_compatibility import ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter
        >>>
        >>> # Create session with custom retry configuration
        >>> session = create_arris_compatible_session()
        >>>
        >>> # Configure aggressive retry strategy for problematic networks
        >>> retry_strategy = Retry(
        ...     total=7,                        # More retries for unreliable connections
        ...     status_forcelist=[408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
        ...     allowed_methods=["POST", "GET"],
        ...     backoff_factor=1.0,             # Longer backoff for congested networks
        ...     respect_retry_after_header=True,
        ...     raise_on_status=False           # Don't raise on status codes
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Apply custom retry strategy
        >>> custom_adapter = ArrisCompatibleHTTPAdapter(
        ...     instrumentation=instrumentation,
        ...     max_retries=retry_strategy,
        ...     pool_connections=1,
        ...     pool_maxsize=3
        ... )
        >>> session.mount("https://", custom_adapter)
        >>> session.mount("http://", custom_adapter)
