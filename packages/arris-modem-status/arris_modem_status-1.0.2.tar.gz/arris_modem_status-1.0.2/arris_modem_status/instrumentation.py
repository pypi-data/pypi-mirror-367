Performance Instrumentation for Arris Modem Status Client
========================================================

This module provides comprehensive performance instrumentation for monitoring,
measuring, and analyzing the performance characteristics of the Arris modem client.

The instrumentation system captures detailed timing metrics for all operations,
enabling performance optimization, bottleneck identification, and operational
monitoring. It's designed with minimal overhead while providing maximum insight
into client behavior.

Key Features:
    * **Operation Timing**: Precise timing of individual HNAP requests, authentication
      flows, and data retrieval operations
    * **Performance Analytics**: Statistical analysis including percentiles, success
      rates, and throughput measurements
    * **Error Correlation**: Links performance degradation with specific error types
    * **HTTP Compatibility Tracking**: Measures overhead from compatibility adaptations
    * **Monitoring Integration**: Provides metrics suitable for external monitoring

Performance Tracking Categories:
    The instrumentation tracks several categories of operations:

    * **Authentication Operations**: Login challenges, credential computation, session setup
    * **Data Retrieval**: Channel information, status requests, system information
    * **HTTP Layer**: Raw socket communication, parsing, retry handling
    * **Error Recovery**: Retry attempts, fallback mechanisms, recovery success

Typical Usage Patterns:
    Basic instrumentation for timing an operation:

    >>> from arris_modem_status.instrumentation import PerformanceInstrumentation
    >>> instrumentation = PerformanceInstrumentation()
    >>>
    >>> # Time an operation
    >>> start_time = instrumentation.start_timer("authentication")
    >>> # ... perform operation ...
    >>> metric = instrumentation.record_timing("authentication", start_time, success=True)
    >>> print(f"Operation took {metric.duration_ms:.1f}ms")

    Comprehensive performance monitoring:

    >>> # Enable instrumentation in client
    >>> from arris_modem_status import ArrisModemStatusClient
    >>> client = ArrisModemStatusClient(
    ...     password="your_password",
    ...     enable_instrumentation=True
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> with client:
    ...     status = client.get_status()
    ...     metrics = client.get_performance_metrics()
    ...
    ...     # Analyze performance
    ...     session_time = metrics['session_metrics']['total_session_time']
    ...     success_rate = (metrics['session_metrics']['successful_operations'] /
    ...                    metrics['session_metrics']['total_operations'])
    ...
    ...     print(f"Session completed in {session_time:.2f}s")
    ...     print(f"Success rate: {success_rate * 100:.1f}%")

    Performance analysis and optimization:

    >>> # Get detailed performance breakdown
    >>> summary = instrumentation.get_performance_summary()
    >>>
    >>> # Identify slow operations
    >>> for operation, stats in summary['operation_breakdown'].items():
    ...     if stats['avg_time'] > 2.0:  # Slow operations
    ...         print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  {operation}: {stats['avg_time']:.2f}s average")
    ...
    >>> # Check for performance insights
    >>> for insight in summary['performance_insights']:
    ...     print(f"üí° {insight}")

Monitoring Integration:
    The instrumentation provides metrics suitable for external monitoring systems
    like Prometheus, Grafana, or custom dashboards:

    >>> # Extract metrics for monitoring
    >>> summary = instrumentation.get_performance_summary()
    >>>
    >>> # Export to monitoring system
    >>> monitoring_metrics = {
    ...     'total_operations': summary['session_metrics']['total_operations'],
    ...     'success_rate': summary['session_metrics']['successful_operations'] /
    ...                    summary['session_metrics']['total_operations'],
    ...     'p95_response_time': summary['response_time_percentiles']['p95'],
    ...     'error_rate': summary['session_metrics']['failed_operations'] /
    ...                  summary['session_metrics']['total_operations'],
    ... }

Performance Considerations:
    The instrumentation is designed for minimal overhead:

    * Timing operations use `time.time()` for sub-millisecond precision
    * Metrics are stored in memory and aggregated on-demand
    * No I/O operations during normal timing collection
    * Configurable error capture to balance detail vs. performance

Error Analysis Integration:
    Performance metrics are correlated with error analysis to provide insights
    into reliability and recovery patterns:

    >>> # Analyze error impact on performance
    >>> if summary['session_metrics']['http_compatibility_overhead'] > 1.0:
    ...     print("‚ö†Ô∏è  Significant HTTP compatibility overhead detected")
    ...     print("Consider reviewing modem firmware or network configuration")

Implementation Notes:
    * All timing operations are thread-safe for concurrent use
    * Metrics are aggregated per operation type for statistical analysis
    * The system handles clock adjustments and maintains relative timing accuracy
    * Memory usage scales linearly with operation count (typically < 1MB for normal sessions)

class PerformanceInstrumentation:
    """
    Comprehensive performance instrumentation for the Arris modem client.

    This class provides detailed performance monitoring capabilities including
    operation timing, statistical analysis, and performance insights. It's designed
    to help identify bottlenecks, monitor reliability, and optimize client performance.

    The instrumentation tracks multiple categories of metrics:

    * **Timing Metrics**: Start time, end time, duration for each operation
    * **Success Metrics**: Success/failure rates, retry counts, recovery patterns
    * **HTTP Metrics**: Status codes, response sizes, compatibility overhead
    * **Statistical Analysis**: Percentiles, averages, throughput calculations

    Typical workflow:
        1. Initialize instrumentation (typically done by ArrisModemStatusClient)
        2. Start timing operations with start_timer()
        3. Record completed operations with record_timing()
        4. Analyze performance with get_performance_summary()
        5. Extract insights and monitoring metrics

    The class maintains session-wide state and provides both real-time metrics
    and historical analysis capabilities.

    Attributes:
        timing_metrics: List of all recorded TimingMetrics objects
        session_start_time: When this instrumentation session began
        auth_metrics: Authentication-specific performance data (currently unused)
        request_metrics: Aggregated timing data by operation type

    Examples:
        Basic operation timing:

        >>> instrumentation = PerformanceInstrumentation()
        >>> start_time = instrumentation.start_timer("database_query")
        >>> # ... perform database operation ...
        >>> metric = instrumentation.record_timing(

        ...     start_time,
        ...     success=True,
        ...     response_size=1024
        ... )
        >>> print(f"Query took {metric.duration_ms}ms")

        Performance analysis:

        >>> summary = instrumentation.get_performance_summary()
        >>> print(f"Total operations: {summary['session_metrics']['total_operations']}")
        >>> print(f"Success rate: {summary['session_metrics']['successful_operations'] / summary['session_metrics']['total_operations']:.1%}")
        >>>
        >>> # Check operation breakdown
        >>> for op, stats in summary['operation_breakdown'].items():
        ...     print(f"{op}: {stats['avg_time']:.3f}s avg, {stats['success_rate']:.1%} success")

        Monitoring integration:

        >>> # Extract key metrics for monitoring dashboard
        >>> metrics = summary['session_metrics']
        >>> percentiles = summary['response_time_percentiles']
        >>>
        >>> monitoring_data = {

        ...     'http_compatibility_overhead_ms': metrics['http_compatibility_overhead'] * 1000
        ... }

    Performance Characteristics:
        * Memory usage: ~100 bytes per recorded operation
        * Timing overhead: < 1Œºs per start_timer() call
        * Analysis overhead: O(n log n) for percentile calculations
        * Thread safety: All methods are thread-safe for concurrent use

        Generate automated performance insights and recommendations.

        Analyzes operation statistics and session performance to provide
        actionable insights about performance characteristics, potential
        issues, and optimization opportunities.

        Args:
            operation_stats: Per-operation statistics from get_performance_summary()

        Generated Insights:
            * **Authentication Performance**: Analysis of login/auth timing
            * **Throughput Analysis**: Operations per second and efficiency
            * **Reliability Analysis**: Error rates and success patterns
            * **Performance Classification**: High/medium/low performance ratings

        Examples of Generated Insights:
            ```
            "Excellent authentication performance: 0.8s"
            "High throughput: 2.1 operations/sec"
