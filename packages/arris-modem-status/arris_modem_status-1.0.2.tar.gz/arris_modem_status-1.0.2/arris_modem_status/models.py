Data Models and Structures for Arris Modem Status Client
=======================================================

This module provides the core data models and structures used throughout the Arris modem client,
implementing a comprehensive dataclass-based architecture for representing modem diagnostic data,
performance metrics, and error analysis information. The models are designed with production
reliability, type safety, and seamless integration with monitoring systems in mind.

The data model architecture follows modern Python best practices with dataclasses, type hints,
automatic field validation, and performance optimization. Each model serves as both a data
container and a business logic component, providing automatic formatting, validation, and
integration capabilities that make complex modem data accessible and reliable.

Core Design Philosophy:
    * **Type Safety First**: Comprehensive type annotations with runtime validation
    * **Automatic Formatting**: Intelligent field processing and display formatting
    * **Production Ready**: Memory-efficient structures with monitoring integration
    * **Developer Friendly**: Rich examples and intuitive APIs for common operations
    * **Extensible Architecture**: Clean inheritance patterns and composition support

Data Model Categories:
    The module provides three primary categories of data models:

    **Performance Models**: Timing metrics, instrumentation data, and performance analysis
    **Diagnostic Models**: Channel information, signal quality data, and hardware diagnostics
    **Error Models**: Comprehensive error capture, analysis data, and debugging context

Real-World Integration Examples:
    The models integrate seamlessly with the broader client architecture:

    Basic Usage Pattern:
        >>> from arris_modem_status.models import ChannelInfo, TimingMetrics, ErrorCapture
        >>>
        >>> # Create channel with automatic formatting
        >>> channel = ChannelInfo(
        ...     channel_id="1",
        ...     frequency="549000000",    # Auto-formatted to "549000000 Hz"
        ...     power="0.6",             # Auto-formatted to "0.6 dBmV"
        ...     snr="39.0",              # Auto-formatted to "39.0 dB"
        ...     modulation="256QAM",
        ...     lock_status="Locked",
        ...     corrected_errors="15",
        ...     uncorrected_errors="0",
        ...     channel_type="downstream"
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Analyze channel health
        >>> if channel.is_locked():
        ...     print(f"Channel {channel.channel_id} is operational")
        ...     quality = channel.get_signal_quality()
        ...     print(f"Signal quality: {quality}")

    Performance Monitoring Integration:
        >>> # Record timing metrics for operations
        >>> start_time = time.time()
        >>> # ... perform operation ...
        >>> end_time = time.time()
        >>>
        >>> metric = TimingMetrics(
        ...     operation="data_processing",
        ...     start_time=start_time,
        ...     end_time=end_time,
        ...     duration=end_time - start_time,
        ...     success=True,
        ...     response_size=2048
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> if metric.is_slow():
        ...     print(f"Slow operation: {metric.operation} took {metric.duration_ms}ms")

Production Deployment Patterns:
    The models are optimized for production environments with comprehensive
    monitoring, logging, and operational support:

    Memory Efficiency:
        * Models use efficient data structures for minimal memory footprint
        * Bulk processing optimized for large numbers of channels
        * Typical memory usage: ~200-300 bytes per ChannelInfo instance

    Serialization and APIs:
        * All models support JSON serialization via dataclasses.asdict()
        * Optimized for integration with monitoring systems
        * Human-readable string representations for debugging

    Validation and Quality Assurance:
        * Built-in field validation during initialization
        * Signal quality assessment methods for channel health monitoring
        * Error analysis capabilities for troubleshooting

Thread Safety and Concurrency:
    All models are designed for safe concurrent access in multi-threaded environments.
    Models are immutable after creation and safe for concurrent access.

Cross-Platform Compatibility:
    The models handle platform-specific considerations for deployment across
    Windows, Linux, and macOS environments with proper path handling and
    time zone aware datetime processing.

This comprehensive data model foundation provides the reliability, performance,
and extensibility needed for production modem monitoring and diagnostic applications
while maintaining the simplicity and developer experience that makes the library
accessible and maintainable.

    This dataclass captures detailed performance data for all client operations, providing
    the foundation for performance analysis, bottleneck identification, and operational
    monitoring. It integrates seamlessly with monitoring systems while providing rich
    debugging capabilities for development and troubleshooting.

    The class serves as both a data container and a performance analysis tool, offering
    calculated properties, validation methods, and integration hooks for external
    monitoring systems. All timing data is captured with sub-millisecond precision
    and includes comprehensive context for correlation with system behavior.

    Attributes:
        operation: Name/type of the operation being measured (e.g., "authentication",
                  "get_status", "hnap_request", "channel_parsing"). Used for grouping
                  and analysis in monitoring systems.

        start_time: High-precision start timestamp from time.time(). Represents the
                   exact moment operation began, including any setup or preparation time.

        end_time: High-precision end timestamp from time.time(). Represents the
                 exact moment operation completed, whether successfully or with failure.

                 direct access to operation timing without requiring recalculation.

        success: Boolean indicating whether the operation completed successfully.
                Used for success rate calculations and error correlation analysis.

        error_type: Optional classification of error if operation failed. Examples:
                   "TimeoutError", "ConnectionError", "HTTPError", "ParsingError".
                   Enables error pattern analysis and debugging workflows.

        retry_count: Number of retry attempts made during this operation. Indicates
                    operation reliability and helps identify flaky network conditions
                    or modem responsiveness issues.

        http_status: Optional HTTP status code for HTTP-based operations. Provides
                    detailed context for web request performance and error analysis.

        response_size: Size of response data in bytes. Enables bandwidth analysis,
                      performance correlation with data size, and capacity planning.

    Examples:
        Basic timing metrics creation and analysis:

        >>> import time
        >>> start_time = time.time()
        >>> # ... perform operation ...
        >>> end_time = time.time()
        >>>
        >>> metric = TimingMetrics(
        ...     operation="user_authentication",
        ...     start_time=start_time,
        ...     end_time=end_time,
        ...     duration=end_time - start_time,
        ...     success=True,
        ...     http_status=200,
        ...     response_size=512
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> print(f"Authentication took {metric.duration_ms:.1f}ms")
        >>> if metric.is_slow():
        ...     print("Slow authentication detected")

        Performance analysis workflows:

        >>> def analyze_performance_metrics(metrics: list[TimingMetrics]) -> dict:
        ...     analysis = {
        ...         'total_operations': len(metrics),
        ...         'success_rate': sum(1 for m in metrics if m.success) / len(metrics),
        ...         'avg_duration_ms': sum(m.duration_ms for m in metrics) / len(metrics),
        ...         'slow_operations': [m for m in metrics if m.is_slow()]
        ...     }
        ...     return analysis

    Integration with monitoring systems:
        TimingMetrics can be easily exported to monitoring systems like Prometheus,
        Grafana, or custom dashboards using standard serialization methods.

    Thread Safety:
        TimingMetrics objects are immutable after creation and safe for concurrent
        access in multi-threaded environments.

    This comprehensive timing metrics system provides the foundation for production-ready
    performance monitoring, enabling development teams to identify bottlenecks, monitor
    system health, and optimize application performance with detailed, actionable data.

                   "timeout", "connection", "parsing_failed"). Enables programmatic
                   error handling and recovery decision making.

        raw_error: Original error message or exception details. Preserves complete
                  error information for debugging while providing structured access
                  through other fields for automated processing.

        response_headers: HTTP response headers as key-value dictionary. Critical for
                         debugging HTTP issues, understanding server behavior, and
                         identifying protocol-level problems.

        partial_content: Truncated response content for analysis. Provides insight into
                        response structure and content without storing large response
                        bodies that could impact memory usage.

        recovery_successful: Whether automatic recovery was attempted and succeeded.
                           Tracks the effectiveness of retry logic and fallback
                           mechanisms for reliability analysis.

class ChannelInfo:
    """
    Comprehensive channel diagnostic information with intelligent data processing and validation.

    This dataclass represents a single modem channel (downstream or upstream) with complete
    diagnostic information including signal levels, error counts, modulation details, and
    automatically formatted display values. It serves as both a data container and a
    diagnostic analysis tool, providing methods for signal quality assessment, error
    analysis, and integration with monitoring systems.

    The class implements sophisticated data processing including automatic unit formatting,
    field validation, signal quality analysis, and performance optimization for bulk
    channel processing. All numeric fields are intelligently parsed and formatted for
    both human display and programmatic analysis.

        channel_id: Channel identifier string (e.g., "1", "2", "3"). Used for display
                   and correlation with modem configuration. Typically numeric but
                   stored as string for consistent handling.

        frequency: Channel frequency with automatic Hz unit formatting. Raw numeric
                  values are automatically formatted during initialization (e.g.,
                  "549000000" becomes "549000000 Hz").

        power: Signal power level with automatic dBmV unit formatting. Critical for
              signal quality assessment and troubleshooting (e.g., "0.6" becomes "0.6 dBmV").

        snr: Signal-to-noise ratio with automatic dB unit formatting. Key metric for
            downstream channel quality assessment (e.g., "39.0" becomes "39.0 dB").
            Set to "N/A" for upstream channels which don't report SNR.

        modulation: Modulation scheme used by the channel (e.g., "256QAM", "SC-QAM",
                   "OFDMA"). Indicates channel technology and expected performance
                   characteristics.

        lock_status: Channel lock status indicating connection stability. Common values
                    include "Locked", "Unlocked", "Partial". Only locked channels
                    carry data traffic reliably.

        corrected_errors: Number of corrected errors for downstream channels (optional).
                         Indicates minor signal issues that were successfully recovered.
                         High values may indicate signal quality degradation.

        uncorrected_errors: Number of uncorrected errors for downstream channels (optional).
                           Indicates serious signal issues that resulted in data loss.
                           Any uncorrected errors indicate connectivity problems.

        channel_type: Channel type classification ("downstream", "upstream", "unknown").
                     Determines which fields are relevant and which analysis methods
                     to apply for signal quality assessment.

    Examples:
        Basic channel creation and analysis:

        >>> # Create downstream channel with comprehensive diagnostics
        >>> channel = ChannelInfo(
        ...     channel_id="1",
        ...     frequency="549000000",    # Auto-formatted to "549000000 Hz"
        ...     power="0.6",             # Auto-formatted to "0.6 dBmV"
        ...     snr="39.0",              # Auto-formatted to "39.0 dB"
        ...     modulation="256QAM",
        ...     lock_status="Locked",
        ...     corrected_errors="15",
        ...     uncorrected_errors="0",
        ...     channel_type="downstream"
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Analyze channel health
        >>> if channel.is_locked():
        ...     print(f"Channel {channel.channel_id} is operational")
        ...     quality = channel.get_signal_quality()
        ...     print(f"Signal quality: {quality}")
        ...     if channel.has_errors():
        ...         print(f"Error count: {channel.get_total_errors()}")

        ...         if channel.is_locked():
        ...             analysis['locked_channels'] += 1
        ...
        ...         quality = channel.get_signal_quality()
        ...         if quality in ['poor', 'critical']:
        ...             analysis['problematic_channels'].append({
        ...                 'channel_id': channel.channel_id,
        ...                 'quality': quality,
        ...                 'power': channel.power,
        ...                 'errors': channel.get_total_errors()
        ...             })
        ...
        ...         analysis['total_errors'] += channel.get_total_errors()
        ...
        ...     return analysis

        Signal quality assessment and alerting:

        >>> def generate_channel_alerts(channels: list[ChannelInfo]) -> list[str]:
        ...     alerts = []
        ...
        ...     # Check for unlocked channels

        ...         channel_ids = [ch.channel_id for ch in unlocked]
        ...         alerts.append(f"Unlocked channels detected: {', '.join(channel_ids)}")
        ...
        ...     # Check for high error rates
        ...     high_error_channels = [ch for ch in channels
        ...                           if ch.channel_type == "downstream" and ch.get_total_errors() > 100]
        ...     if high_error_channels:
        ...         channel_ids = [ch.channel_id for ch in high_error_channels]
        ...         alerts.append(f"High error channels: {', '.join(channel_ids)}")

        ...         alerts.append(f"Poor signal quality: {', '.join(channel_ids)}")
        ...
        ...     return alerts

        Post-initialization processing for automatic data formatting and validation.

        Performs intelligent field processing including unit formatting, data validation,
        and consistency checks. This method ensures all channel data is consistently
        formatted and ready for both display and programmatic analysis regardless
        of input data variations.

        Field Processing:
            * **Frequency**: Adds "Hz" suffix to numeric frequency values
            * **Power**: Adds "dBmV" suffix to numeric power values
            * **SNR**: Adds "dB" suffix to numeric SNR values (except "N/A")
