# Consenrich

Consenrich is an adaptive linear filter for genome-wide estimation of signals hidden in
noisy multi-sample HTS datasets. A corresponding manuscript preprint is available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.05.636702v2).

Consenrich supports a variety of functional genomics assays including ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, etc.
