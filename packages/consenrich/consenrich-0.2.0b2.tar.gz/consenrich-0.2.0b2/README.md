# Consenrich (branch: `lean`)

---

The `lean` branch introduces a substantial internal refactor that positions Consenrich for a long-term, stable, API. Underlying methodology and functionality remain unchanged, but the following improvements are introduced:

* Core methodological aspects are now self-contained, allowing users greater flexibility to separate preprocessing and primary analysis for contexts that may require unique normalization techniques, transformations of data, or other preprocessing steps.

* Consistent, documented naming conventions for modules, functions, and arguments.

* Performance upgrades â€” Several previous bottlenecks are now rewritten in Cython, and alignment-level processing is buffered to restrict and configure memory use.

After `lean` is merged into `main`, some previous interfaces will become deprecated but remain accessible through older tagged versions of Consenrich.

Consenrich is a sequential state estimator for extraction of genome-wide epigenetic signals in noisy, multi-sample high-throughput functional genomics datasets.
