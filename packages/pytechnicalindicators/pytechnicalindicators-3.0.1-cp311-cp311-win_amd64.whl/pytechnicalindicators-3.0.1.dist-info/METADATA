# üêç Meet PyTechnicalIndicators

Say hello to PyTechnicalIndicators, the Python-powered bridge to the battle-tested performance of RustTI! ü¶Äüêçüìà

Built on top of the RustTI core, PyTechnicalIndicators brings blazing-fast technical indicators to Python, perfect for quants, traders, and anyone who needs robust, high-performance financial analytics in their Python workflows.

Welcome to PyTechnicalIndicators ‚Äî powered by Rust, ready for Python.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

> The fastest way to get up and running with PyTechnicalIndicators.

**1. Install PyTechnicalIndicators:**

```shell
pip install pytechnicalindicators
```

**2. Calculate your first indicator:**

```python
import pytechnicalindicators as pti

prices = [100.2, 100.46, 100.53, 100.38, 100.19]

ma = pti.moving_average(
    prices,
    "simple"
)
print(f"Simple Moving Average: {ma}")
```

Expected output:
```
Simple Moving Average: 100.352
```

## üìö Reference

**COMING SOON!**

### Example

A reference of how to call each function can be found in the tests:

- [Reference Example](./tests/)

Clone and run:

```shell
$ source you_venv_location/bin/activate

$ pip3 install -r test_requirements.txt

$ maturin develop

$ pytest .

```

### Library Structure

- Modules based on their analysis areas (**`moving_average`**, **`momentum_indicators`**, **`strength_indicators`**...)
- `bulk` & `single` function variants  
  - `bulk`: Compute indicator over rolling periods, returns a list.
  - `single`: Compute indicator for the entire list, returns a single value.
- Types used to personalise the technical indicators (**`moving_average_type`**, **`deviation_model`**, **`contant_model_type`**...)

## üß† Explanation & Design

### Why PyTechnicalIndicators?

- **Performance:** Rust-powered backend for maximal speed, safety, and low overhead.
- **Configurability:** Most indicators are highly customizable‚Äîtweak calculation methods, periods, or even use medians instead of means.
- **Breadth:** Covers a wide range of technical indicators out of the box.
- **Advanced Use:** Designed for users who understand technical analysis and want deep control.

**Note:** Some features may require background in technical analysis. See [Investopedia: Technical Analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) for a primer.
