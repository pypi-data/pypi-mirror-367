## IDPEnsembleTools: An Open-Source Library for Analysis of Conformational Ensembles of Disordered Proteins

IDPEnsembleTools is a Python package designed to facilitate the **loading, analysis, and comparison** of multiple conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).

It supports various input formats such as `.pdb`, `.xtc`, and `.dcd`, and enables users to extract both **global** and **local** structural features, perform dimensionality reduction, and compute similarity scores between ensembles.

## ðŸ”§ Features

With **IDPEnsembleTools**, you can:

- **Extract global features** of structural ensembles:
  - Radius of gyration (Rg)
  - Asphericity
  - Prolateness
  - End-to-end distance

- **Extract local features**:
  - Interatomic distances
  - Phiâ€“psi angles
  - Alpha-helix content

- **Perform dimensionality reduction** on ensemble features:
  - PCA
  - UMAP
  - t-SNE

- **Compare structural ensembles** using:
  - Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence
  - Visualize similarity matrices
