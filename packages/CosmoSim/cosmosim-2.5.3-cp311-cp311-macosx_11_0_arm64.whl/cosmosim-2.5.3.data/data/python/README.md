# Python scripts

These scripts do not depend on the CosmoSim package or other
C++ code.

Most of the scripts, including amplitudes.py are used to compute
the roulette amplitudes and produce the *.txt files included
in the package distribution (under src/CosmoSim).

The compare.py scripts quantitatively compares two images.
This is used by the regression tests, but may have other
uses for evaluation of experiments.
