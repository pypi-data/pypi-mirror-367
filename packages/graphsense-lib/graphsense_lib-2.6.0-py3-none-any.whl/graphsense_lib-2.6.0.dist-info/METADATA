# graphsense-lib

[![Test and Build Status](https://github.com/graphsense/graphsense-lib/actions/workflows/run_tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/graphsense/graphsense-lib/actions) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/graphsense-lib.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/graphsense-lib) [![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/graphsense-lib)](https://pypi.org/project/graphsense-lib/) [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/graphsense-lib)](https://pepy.tech/project/graphsense-lib)

A central repository for python utility functions and everything that deals with the graphsense backend. Its CLI interface can be used to control important graphsense maintainance tasks.


Note: this library uses optional dependencies. Use all to install all features.

## Use

### As a library

Access the graphsense cassandra db. This requires a graphsense config (see Modules/Config)
```python3
from graphsenselib.db import DbFactory

env, currency = "test", "btc"

with DbFactory().from_config(env, currency) as db:
    print(db.transformed.get_highest_block())
```

Alternatively, the database can also be accessed without relying on the graphsense config file.
```python
from graphsenselib.db import DbFactory

with DbFactory().from_name(
        raw_keyspace_name="eth_raw",
        transformed_keyspace_name="eth_transformed",
        schema_type="account",
        cassandra_nodes = ["test.cassandra1", "test.cassandra2"],
        currency = "eth"
    ) as db:
    print(db.transformed.get_highest_block())
```

### From the commandline.

Graphsenslib exposes a commandline interface - graphsence-cli.

Help can be viewed by:
```bash
> graphsense-cli --help

## Install

To install the package from the python package index run.
```bash
  > pip install graphsense-lib[all]
```

If you want to install it from source run
```bash
  > make install
```
or
```bash
  > pip install .
```

## Development

Caution: python 3.11 is currently not supported. Please use ```python3.10```.

it is advised to use a virtual environment (venv) for development. Run the following command to initialize one
```bash
    > python3 -m venv .venv
```

and activate it (in bash) using

```bash
    > source .venv/bin/activate
```
 For more information refer to ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)). Run

```bash
    > make dev
```

to initialize the dev environment.
If you want to install graphsenselib in development mode run

```bash
    > make install-dev
```

Before committing anything to the repository please format, lint and test your code in that order. Fix all linter warnings and make sure all test are passing before a commit.

Use the following commands for that:
```bash
    > make format
    > make lint
    > make test
```

or equivalently run
```bash
    > make pre-commit
```

Some slow tests are excluded when running make test. Occasionally, one should run
```bash
    > make test-all
```

to run the entire test-suite.

Linting and formatting should be automatically executed on every git commit using pre-commit.

To create the documentation please run:
```bash
    > make docs
```

Creating the docs need python dev dependencies to build see ([Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21530577/fatal-error-python-h-no-such-file-or-directory}))

### Tagging a release

To tag a new release please update the changelog first. Afterwards, update the Version numbers RELEASESEM and RELEASE in the main Makefile.

To apply the tags run
```bash
    > make tag-version
```

### Open SSL - Errors running test suites
Some components used by graphsense-lib use OpenSSL, to provide certain hash functions. Since OpenSSL 3.0 some hash functions needed are not available anymore by default (e.g. ripemd160). This leads to errors while running the test suite. To avoid these errors, enable legacy providers in the OpenSSL config. An example of the necessary changes can be found in the "fix openssl legacy mode" step in .github/workflows/run_tests.yaml
