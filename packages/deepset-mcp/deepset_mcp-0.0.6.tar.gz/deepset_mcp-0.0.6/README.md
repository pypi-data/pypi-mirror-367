# MCP Server for the deepset AI platform

This is the _official_ MCP server for the [deepset AI platform](https://www.deepset.ai/products-and-services/deepset-ai-platform).
It allows Agents in tools like Cursor or Claude Code to build and debug pipelines on the deepset platform.

The MCP server exposes up to 30 hand-crafted tools that are optimized for Agents interacting with the deepset platform.
Using the server, you benefit from faster creation of pipelines or indexes and speedy issue resolution through agentic debugging.

## Installation

Before configuring MCP clients to work with `deepset-mcp`, you need to install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a modern Python package manager.

If `uv` is not installed on your system, you can install it via:

`pipx install uv` (if Python is installed on your system)

or

_Mac/Linux_

`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` (if you do not want to manage a Python installation yourself)

_Windows_

`powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | more"`

Once you have `uv` installed, you can follow one of the guides below to configure `deepset-mcp` with your MCP client of choice.

### Cursor

**Prerequisites**
- Cursor needs to be installed
- You need an account with Cursor
- You need to [create an API key](https://docs.cloud.deepset.ai/docs/generate-api-key) for the deepset platform
- `uv` needs to be installed ([see above](#installation))

**Configuration**

Latest instructions on how to set up an MCP server for Cursor are covered in their [documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/mcp#using-mcp-json).
You can either configure the MCP server for a single Cursor project or globally across all projects.

To configure the `deepset-mcp` server for a single project:

1. create a file with the name `mcp.json` in your `.cursor` directory at the root of the project
2. Add the following configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepset": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["deepset-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DEEPSET_WORKSPACE": "the deepset workspace that you want to use",
        "DEEPSET_API_KEY": "your deepset API key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This creates a virtual environment for the `deepset-mcp` package and runs the command to start the server.
The `deepset-mcp` server should appear in the "Tools & Integrations" section of your "Cursor Settings".
The tools on the server are now available to the Cursor Agent.

It is recommended to create a file named `.cursorrules` at the root of your project (if not already there)
and to add the [recommended prompt](#prompts) to the file.
This ensures optimal integration between the Cursor Agent and the deepset-mcp tools.


### Claude Desktop App

**Prerequisites**
- [Claude Desktop App](https://claude.ai/download) needs to be installed
- You need to be on the Claude Pro, Team, Max, or Enterprise plan
- You need to [create an API key](https://docs.cloud.deepset.ai/docs/generate-api-key) for the deepset platform
- `uv` needs to be installed ([see above](#installation))

**Configuration**

Latest instructions on how to configure Claude Desktop with MCP can be found in [Anthropic's MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).
To configure Claude Desktop with the `deepset-mcp`-package, follow these steps:


1. Go to: `/Users/your_user/Library/Application Support/Claude` (Mac)
2. Either open or create `claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Add the following json as your config (or update your existing config if you are already using other MCP servers)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepset": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["deepset-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DEEPSET_WORKSPACE": "the deepset workspace that you want to use",
        "DEEPSET_API_KEY": "your deepset API key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
4. Quit and start the Claude Desktop App
5. The deepset server should appear in the "Search and Tools" menu (it might take a few seconds to start the server)

For best integration with Claude Desktop, it is recommended to create a Claude Desktop "Project" and to add the
[recommended prompt](#prompts) as the "project instructions".


### Other MCP Clients

`deepset-mcp` can be used with other MCP clients.

Here is where you need to configure `deepset-mcp` for:

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#configure-mcp-servers)
- [Gemini CLI](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer#configure-mcp-servers)

Depending on your installation, you need to configure an MCP client with one of the following commands:

`uvx deepset-mcp --workspace your_workspace --api-key your_api_key`

If you installed the deepset-mcp package globally and added it to your `PATH`, you can just run:

`deepset-mcp --workspace your_workspace --api-key your_api_key`

The server runs locally using `stdio` to communicate with the client.

### Docker

In case you prefer to isolate the `deepset-mcp` server in a Docker container, you can use our [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/deepset/deepset-mcp-server) to run the server.

If running with Docker, you need to use the following configuration with your MCP Client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepset": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-e",
        "DEEPSET_WORKSPACE",
        "-e",
        "DEEPSET_API_KEY",
        "deepset/deepset-mcp-server:main"
      ],
      "env": {
       "DEEPSET_WORKSPACE":"<WORKSPACE>",
       "DEEPSET_API_KEY":"<DEEPSET_API_KEY>"
     }

    }
  }
}
```


## Configuration

### Multiple Workspaces

In the default configuration, the Agent can only interact with resources in a fixed deepset workspace.
You configure this deepset workspace either through the `DEEPSET_WORKSPACE` environment variable
or the `--workspace` option.

The `--workspace-mode`-option (default: `static`) determines if the Agent can interact with a fixed, pre-configured workspace,
or if it should have access to resources in multiple workspaces.
If you want to allow an Agent to access resources from multiple workspaces, use `--workspace-mode dynamic`
in your configuration.

For example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepset": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "deepset-mcp",
        "--workspace-mode",
        "dynamic"
      ],
      "env": {
       "DEEPSET_API_KEY":"<DEEPSET_API_KEY>"
     }
    }
  }
}
```

An Agent using the MCP server can now access all workspaces that the API-key has access to. When interacting with most
resources, you need to tell the agent what workspace it should use to perform an action. Instead of prompting it
with "list my pipelines", you now have to prompt it with "list my pipelines in the staging workspace".


### Manage Tools

Not all tools are needed for all tasks. You can toggle available tools in most MCP clients (e.g. [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/mcp#toggling-tools)).
If your MCP client does not support toggling tools, you can select which tools should be available by using the `--tools`-option.

Run `uvx deepset-mcp --list-tools` in your terminal to get a list of all available tools.

Then update your MCP configuration with the tools that you want to use with your MCP client.

Here is an exemplary Cursor `mcp.json` with tool selection:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepset-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "deepset-mcp",
        "--tools",
        "create_pipeline",
        "get_from_object_store",
        "get_slice_from_object_store",
        "list_pipelines",
        "search_templates"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DEEPSET_WORKSPACE": "",
        "DEEPSET_API_KEY": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server now only exposes the five tools specifically added in the configuration file instead of exposing all tools.


### Reduce Tool Count

You can view documentation for all tools in the [tools section](#tools). For many workflows, you will not need all tools.
In this case, it is recommended to deactivate tools that are not needed. Using fewer tools has the following benefits:

- some MCP clients limit the maximum number of tools
- the Agent will be more focused on the task at hand and not call tools that it does not need
- some savings for input tokens (minimal)

If you are working in `static` workspace mode, you can deactivate the following tools:
- `list_workspaces`
- `get_workspace`
- `create_workspace`

In `dynamic` workspace mode, activate the `list_workspaces` but not the `get_workspace` tool.
You only need to activate the `create_workspace`-tool if you want your Agent to create workspaces.

If you are not working with custom components, you can deactivate the following tools:
- `get_custom_components`
- `get_latest_custom_component_installation_logs`
- `list_custom_component_installations`

For components and templates, the `search` and `get` tools are often sufficient and the Agent does not need access to a dedicated `list` tool.
For that reason, if you need to lower the tool count, you can deactivate the following tools:
- `list_component_families`
- `list_templates`

`list_secrets` and `get_secret` return the same depth of information for each respective secret.
Therefore, you can deactivate the `get_secret`-tool.

If you need to reduce the tool count further, review your objectives and select the tools that the Agent will need to complete your planned tasks.

If your pipelines do not require an index, you can deactivate all [index tools](#indexes).
If you are only working with a single index that is already created and deployed, and you intend to create or debug connected pipelines, you could deactivate
all index tools except `get_index` because the Agent does not need to interact with the index beyond reading its configuration.

If you are only working on indexes but not pipelines, you might deactivate all [pipeline tools](#pipelines).


**Tools You Should Keep**


You should **not** deactivate any tools related to the [object store](#object-store). These tools are special tools that help
with lowering input token count for Agents and speeding up execution by allowing to call tools with outputs from other tools.

The [documentation tool](#documentation) and the [template tools](#templates) are important for most tasks. The Agent
frequently uses templates as examples for pipeline creation or debugging. The documentation helps the Agent to understand
the fundamentals of the platform.


### Prompts

All tools exposed through the MCP server have minimal prompts. Any Agent interacting with these tools benefits from an additional system prompt.

View the **recommended prompt** [here](src/deepset_mcp/prompts/deepset_debugging_agent.md).

In Cursor, add the prompt to `.cursorrules`.

In Claude Desktop, create a "Project" and add the prompt as system instructions.

You may find that customizing the prompt for your specific needs yields best results.


### Providing a Remote MCP Server

The `deepset-mcp` package can be configured to run as a remote MCP server, allowing you to provide deepset platform access to multiple users through a centralized service. This is particularly useful for organizations that want to deploy the MCP server as a shared service or integrate it into existing infrastructure.

**Key Requirements**

When running as a remote MCP server, you must configure the following:

1. **Transport Protocol**: Use `streamable-http` instead of the default `stdio` transport
2. **Authentication**: Implement OAuth or similar authentication flow to securely handle user credentials
3. **Authorization Headers**: Ensure client requests include proper `Authorization` headers with Bearer token for deepset access
4. **Dynamic Workspace Mode**: Use `workspace_mode='dynamic'` to support multiple users with different workspaces
5. **API Key Management**: Enable `get_api_key_from_auth_header` to extract deepset API keys from request headers

**Implementation Example**

Here's a complete example of how to set up a remote MCP server:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from deepset_mcp import configure_mcp_server, WorkspaceMode, ALL_DEEPSET_TOOLS, DEEPSET_DOCS_DEFAULT_SHARE_URL

# Create FastMCP instance
mcp = FastMCP("Deepset Remote MCP Server")

# Add authentication middleware

# Configure the deepset MCP server
configure_mcp_server(
    mcp_server_instance=mcp,
    workspace_mode=WorkspaceMode.DYNAMIC,
    tools_to_register=ALL_DEEPSET_TOOLS,
    deepset_docs_shareable_prototype_url=DEEPSET_DOCS_DEFAULT_SHARE_URL,
    get_api_key_from_authorization_header=True
)

# Run the server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="streamable-http")
```


## Use Cases

The primary way to use the deepset MCP server is through an LLM that interacts with the deepset MCP tools in an agentic way.

### Creating Pipelines

Tell the Agent about the type of pipeline you want to build. Creating new pipelines will work best if you use terminology
that is similar to what is used on the deepset AI platform or in Haystack.

Your prompts should be precise and specific.

Examples:

- "Build a RAG pipeline with hybrid retrieval that uses claude-sonnet-4 from Anthropic as the LLM."
- "Build an Agent that can iteratively search the web (deep research). Use SerperDev for web search and GPT-4o as the LLM."

You can also instruct the Agent to deploy pipelines, and it can issue search requests against pipelines to test them.

**Best Practices**

- be specific in your requests
- point the Agent to examples, if there is already a similar pipeline in your workspace, then ask it to look at it first, 
if you have a template in mind, ask it to look at the template
- instruct the Agent to iterate with you locally before creating the pipeline, have it validate the drafts and then let it 
create it once the pipeline is up to your standards


### Debugging Pipelines

The `deepset-mcp` tools allow Agents to debug pipelines on the deepset AI platform.
Primary tools used for debugging are:
- get_logs
- validate_pipeline
- search_pipeline
- search_pipeline_templates
- search_component_definition

You can ask the Agent to check the logs of a specific pipeline in case it is already deployed but has errors.
The Agent will find errors in the logs and devise strategies to fix them.
If your pipeline is not deployed yet, the Agent can autonomously validate it and fix validation errors.

## Reference

### deepset-mcp

The `deepset-mcp` command starts the Deepset MCP server to interact with the deepset AI platform.

You can run it in your terminal via `uvx deepset-mcp`.

If you want to run a specific version, you can run:

`uvx --from "deepset-mcp==0.0.3" deepset-mcp`

The following options are available:

### Tools

The deepset-mcp package exposes a set of tools to interact with the deepset platform. Tools can be activated or deactivated
in most MCP clients. Users can also use the `--tools` option to configure which tools should be provided by the MCP server.

## Known Limitations

This MCP server is in Beta. Please report any issues you may face through a GitHub Issue.
Feature requests and feedback are also appreciated.

**Updating Deployed Pipelines**

When a pipeline is deployed and updated through the `update_pipeline` tool, the update takes 30 to 300 seconds to apply.
The tool is currently returning before the pipeline update is applied. This may lead to situations where the Agent might have
already fixed an issue with a pipeline but when it tests it through search, the fix is not applied yet.
This might lead to the Agent repeatedly trying different update strategies, although no further action might be required.
You can check the state of the update in the pipeline logs. If "Application Startup Complete" appears in the logs,
the pipeline update should be applied.

**Deploying Indexes**

When an index is deployed, we are currently not waiting for the deployment to complete before returning a success message.
If the Agent deploys an index and tries a search immediately after, the search request may fail because the deployment is still in progress.
