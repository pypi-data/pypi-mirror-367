libcasm-mapping
===============

The libcasm-mapping package is the CASM structure mapping module. This includes:

- Methods for searching for low-cost lattice, atom, and structure mappings, taking into account symmetry, based on the approach described in the paper `Thomas, Natarajan, and Van der Ven, npj Computational Materials, 7 (2021), 164 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-021-00627-0>`_.
- Methods for generating interpolated structures based on mapping results
- Methods for generating symmetrically equivalent mappings
- Data structures and methods for creating custom mapping searches


About CASM
==========

The libcasm-global package is part of the CASM_ open source software package, which is designed to perform first-principles statistical mechanical studies of multi-component crystalline solids.

CASM is developed by the Van der Ven group, originally at the University of Michigan and currently at the University of California Santa Barbara.
