and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.0] - 2025-08-07

### Added

- Added `CASM::mapping::DispOnlyAtomToSiteCostFunction`, which has the same definition of `CASM::mapping::AtomToSiteCostFunction` previous to this release.
- Added `libcasm.mapping.mapsearch.make_atom_to_site_cost_future`. This method makes the cost infinity for displacements that are on the boundary of the Voronio cell. This addresses an issue where the choice of displacement vector for atoms on the parent superlattice voronoi cell boundary was ambiguous and in practice sensitive to small numerical differences, leading to inconsistent mapping results. With the change, atom mappings with displacements on the Voronoi cell boundary will not be selected, and larger supercells will be necessary to find atom mappings with those assignments.
- Added an `atom_to_site_cost_future_f` argument for the `MapSearch` and `AtomMappingSearchData` constructors to allow use of `make_atom_to_site_cost_future` instead of `make_atom_to_site_cost`.

### Changed

- Changed `CASM::mapping::AtomToSiteCostFunction` to take the Lattice used to find displacements under periodic boundary conditions.

### Deprecated

- The `make_atom_to_site_cost_future` and `make_atom_to_site_cost` methods are marked deprecated because `make_atom_to_site_cost_future` is planned to replace `make_atom_to_site_cost` in libcasm-mapping 3.0.0.
- The `atom_to_site_cost_f` and `atom_to_site_cost_future_f` arguments for the `MapSearch` and `AtomMappingSearchData` constructors are marked deprecated because `atom_to_site_cost_future_f` is planned to replace `atom_to_site_cost_f`  in libcasm-mapping 3.0.0.

## [v2.0a6] - 2024-09-05

### Fixed

- Fixed `make_mapped_structure` to properly handle atom properties (i.e. forces) with implied vacancies.


## [v2.0a5] - 2024-08-18

### Added

- Added `isotropic_strain_cost` and `symmetry_breaking_strain_cost` to `libcasm.mapping.info`.

## [v2.0a4] - 2024-07-12

### Added

- Added `cost` methods to IsotropicAtomCost, SymmetryBreakingAtomCost, and WeightedTotalCost equivalent to the __call__ operators to improve documentation.

### Changed

- Changed default `atom_cost_f` for libcasm.mapping.mapsearch.MappingSearch to IsotropicAtomCost.
- Changed MappingSearch node insertion so that nodes are only added to the queue if the total cost is less than or equal to the current max_cost instead of always.
- Wheels compiled with numpy>=2.0.0

### Fixed

- Documentation errors
- Renamed QueueConstraints constructor parameter which was misnamed `min_queue_size` to the correct name `max_queue_size`
- Fixed MappingSearch node insertion so that solutions are only added to the results if the total cost is less than or equal to the current max_cost even if the current number of results is less than k_best.

## [v2.0a1] - 2023-08-17

This release separates out mapping methods from CASM crystallography v1, adds data structures for holding results, adds additional methods for working with mapping results, and provides an alternative mapping search implementation that can be used to construct custom searches. It creates a Python package, libcasm.mapping, that enables using the mapping methods and may be installed via pip install, using scikit-build, CMake, and pybind11. This release also includes usage examples and API documentation for using libcasm.mapping, built using Sphinx.

### Added

- Added the casm/mapping C++ module with new data structures and methods in namespace CASM::mapping, and with CASM v1 mapping code under namespace CASM::mapping::impl
- Added mapping::LatticeMapping, mapping::AtomMapping, and mapping::StructureMapping data structures for holding individual mapping results
- Added mapping::ScoredLatticeMapping, mapping::ScoredAtomMapping, and mapping::ScoredStructureMapping data structures for holding mapping results along with mapping costs
- Added mapping::LatticeMappingResults, mapping::AtomMappingResults, and mapping::StructureMappingResults data structures for holding multiple mapping results along with mapping costs
- Added mapping::interpolated_mapping for constructing structures that are interpolated between two structures along a particular mapping path
- Added mapping::make_mapping_to_equivalent_structure to generate symmetrically equivalent mappings
- Added mapping::make_mapping_to_equivalent_superlattice to generate mappings to a different, but symmetrically equivalent superlattice of the prim
- Added mapping::make_mapped_structure for applying a mapping::StructureMapping result to an unmapped structure to construct the mapped structure aligned to the parent crystal structure, with implied vacancies, strain, and atomic displacement; This can be used be copied to configuration degree of freedom (DoF) values and calculated properties.
- Added mapping::MappingSearch class and related data structures and methods to perform the mapping search method
- Added Python package libcasm.mapping.info for mapping data structures
- Added Python package libcasm.mapping.methods for the existing lattice, atom, and structure mapping methods
