# dbt-colibri

**dbt-colibri** is a lightweight, developer-friendly CLI tool and self-hostable dashboard that extracts and visualizes **full column-level lineage** from your `dbt-core` project — no cloud syncs, agents, or vendor lock-in required.

It’s built for data teams who want a transparent, flexible, and open approach to lineage tracking without relying on complex enterprise tooling.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Column-level lineage graph**: Understand how every column is derived across models  
- 🔍 **Model + column metadata**: Parse directly from `dbt`'s manifest and catalog  
- 🧠 **Smart parsing**: Uses the structure of your SQL to extract relationships  
- 📦 **Self-hostable**: Generate static HTML or JSON reports (no server required)  
- 💡 Built for `dbt-core` users working locally or in CI pipelines
