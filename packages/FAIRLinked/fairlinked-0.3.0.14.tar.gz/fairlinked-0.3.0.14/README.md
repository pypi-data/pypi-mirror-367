# FAIRLinked

FAIRLinked is a powerful tool for transforming research data into FAIR-compliant RDF using the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary. It helps you align tabular or semi-structured datasets with the MDS-Onto ontology and convert them into Linked Data formats, enhancing interoperability, discoverability, and reuse.

With FAIRLinked, you can:

- Convert CSV/Excel/JSON into RDF, JSON-LD, or OWL
- Automatically download and track the latest MDS-Onto ontology files
- Add or search terms in your ontology files with ease
- Generate metadata summaries and RDF templates
- Prepare datasets for FAIR repository submission

This tool is actively developed and maintained by the **SDLE Research Center at Case Western Reserve University** and is used in multiple federally funded projects.

## ✨ New in v0.3

Version 0.3 brings a major expansion of FAIRLinked's capabilities with:

- ✅ **New term addition** to ontologies (`add_ontology_term.py`)
- ✅ **Search/filter terms** in existing RDF files (`search_ontology_terms.py`)
- ✅ **Data format conversions**: CSV ⇌ JSON-LD, RDF ⇌ Table
- ✅ **Metadata extractors** for RDF subject-label-value triples
- ✅ **Namespace template generators** to assist in new dataset creation
- ✅ **Auto web scraping** to fetch the latest MDS-Onto `.ttl`, `.jsonld`, `.nt`, and `.owl` files from the official Bitbucket
- ✅ **Robust CLI handlers** with built-in validations and retry logic
- ✅ **Modular file outputs** including support for `.ttl`, `.jsonld`, `.owl`, `.nt`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.parquet`, `.arrow`

Documentations of how to use functions in FAIRLinked can be found [here](https://fairlinked.readthedocs.io/)

## 🐍 Python Installation

You can install FAIRLinked using pip:

```bash
pip install FAIRLinked
```
---

## Interface MDS Subpackage

```python
import FAIRLinked.InterfaceMDS
```
Functions in Interface MDS allow users to interact with MDS-Onto and search for terms relevant to their domains. This include loading MDS-Onto into an RDFLib Graph, view domains and subdomains, term search, and add new ontology terms to a local copy.

## RDF Table Conversion Subpackage

```python
import FAIRLinked.RDFTableConversion
```
Functions in this subpackage allow to generate a JSON-LD metadata template from a CSV with MDS-compliant terms, generate JSON-LDs filled with data and MDS semantic relationships, and then convert a directory of JSON-LDs back into tabular format. 

## RDF DataCube Workflow

```python
import FAIRLinked.QBWorkflow.rdf_data_cube_workflow as rdf_data_cube_workflow
from rdf_data_cube_workflow import rdf_data_cube_workflow_start

rdf_data_cube_workflow_start()

```

The RDF DataCube workflow turns tabular data into a format compliant with the [RDF Data Cube vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/).
