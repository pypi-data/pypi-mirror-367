## Suppressing checks

Checks can be suppressed using comment-based 'pragmas' at the end of the source line:

```cmake
set_target_properties(
    my_lib
    PROPERTIES
        CXX_STANDARD 14 # nocheck
        CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON
        CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF
)
```

For compatibility with other tools, any the following will also work:

```cmake
# nolint

# check-cmake ignore
# lint-cmake ignore
# cmake-check ignore
# cmake-lint ignore

# check-cmake disable
# lint-cmake disable
# cmake-check disable
# cmake-lint disable

# check-cmake: ignore
# lint-cmake: ignore
# cmake-check: ignore
# cmake-lint: ignore

# check-cmake: disable
# lint-cmake: disable
# cmake-check: disable
# cmake-lint: disable
```
