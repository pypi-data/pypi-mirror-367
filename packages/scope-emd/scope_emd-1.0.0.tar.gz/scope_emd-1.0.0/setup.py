    long_description="`scope` is the Python-based package for detecting  \
        oscillatory signals in observational or experimental time series with \
        the EMD technique and assessing their statistical significance vs. \
        power-law distributed background noise. Oscillatory processes in real \
        data sets of various origins are often contaminated by a combination of \
        white and coloured noise with a power-law spectral dependence, so \
        that the EMD-revealed intrinsic mode functions need to be rigorously \
        tested against the periodic components generated by noise. To do so, \
        we compute the _EMD energy spectrum_ containing the total energy and \
        dominant period of each EMD-revealed intrinsic mode and the noise \
        confidence limits for modal energy. This allows us to identify the \
        significant mode(s) with the energy beyond the confidence limits, \
        which is expected to be of a non-noise origin and associated with a \
        quasi-periodic oscillatory process of interest. The developed package \
        does not assume the physical origin of the input data set, making it \
        readily applicable for analysing oscillatory processes across various \
        fields of science and industry.",
