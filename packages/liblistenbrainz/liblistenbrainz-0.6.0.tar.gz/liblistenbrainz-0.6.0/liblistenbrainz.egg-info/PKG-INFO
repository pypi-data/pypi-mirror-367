# liblistenbrainz

*liblistenbrainz* is a simple Python library for the
[ListenBrainz Web API](https://listenbrainz.readthedocs.io/en/production/dev/api/).

liblistenbrainz will help you start getting data from and submitting data to
[ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org>) very quickly.

Here's an example of getting the listening history of a ListenBrainz user::

``` python
import liblistenbrainz

client = liblistenbrainz.ListenBrainz()
listens = client.get_listens(username='iliekcomputers')
for listen in listens:
    print("Track name:", listen.track_name)
    print("Artist name:", listen.artist_name)
```

Here's another quick example of how to submit a listen to ListenBrainz::

``` python
import liblistenbrainz
import time

auth_token = input('Please enter your auth token: ')

listen = liblistenbrainz.Listen(
    track_name="Fade",
    artist_name="Kanye West",
    release_name="The Life of Pablo",
    listened_at=int(time.time()),
)

client = liblistenbrainz.ListenBrainz()
client.set_auth_token(auth_token)
response = client.submit_single_listen(listen)
```

More detailed documentation is available
at [Read The Docs](https://liblistenbrainz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
