## 🔍 About the Project

**XFlow** is a lightweight modular machine-learning framework, built with a clear high-level structure and developed through vibe coding.

Originally created for physics research, it's now evolving toward generic scientific applications ML workflows: **Data → Processing → Modeling**

**XFlow** keeps things simple and minimal.

> _Includes reusable modules for datasets, models, training loops, visualization, and logging._
> _Current version: 0.1.0_
