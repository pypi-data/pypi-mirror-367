**pyEulerCurves** is a Python package for computing **Euler Characteristic Curves (ECC)** from point cloud or image data. It provides an intuitive, à la scikit-learn interface and supports fast, parallel computations thanks to its C++ backend. ECCs are powerful topological signatures useful in shape analysis, computer vision, and machine learning.


## 📦 Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pyeulercurves
````

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dioscuri-tda/pyEulerCurves.git
pip install ./pyEulerCurves
```
