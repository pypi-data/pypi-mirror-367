**pyEulerCurves** is a Python package for computing **Euler Characteristic Curves (ECC)** from point cloud or image data. It provides an intuitive, Ã  la scikit-learn interface and supports fast, parallel computations thanks to its C++ backend. ECCs are powerful topological signatures useful in shape analysis, computer vision, and machine learning.
