# REQUIRED: Compartment ID in which instances should be created.
# You should normally see the compartment name when you use the OCI console and
# visit the Compute -> Overview page. It will show "Instances in the XXXX
# Compartment". Below are some common instance compartment IDs in the Linux org.
# If yours is not listed, check out the output of "oci iam compartment list" and
# find the ID there.
instance_compartment_id = INSTANCE_COMPARTMENT_ID

# REQUIRED: Set the OCI region. This takes precedence over anything in
# ~/.oci/config.
#
# Whichever region you choose should be a valid OCI region. There must be a
# corresponding section below, [regions.NAME], which contains region-specific
# configuration information (vcn and subnet).
#
# The region may be overridden on the command line with `yo -r REGION`, in which
# case, a different region (with corresponding config section) will be used. Yo
# maintains separate cache information for each region. Yo commands can only
# operate in one region at a time.

# REQUIRED: The email address below MUST be the one you use to log into OCI.

# REQUIRED: Choose a username to identify you. It will be used in your instance
# names.
my_username = EXAMPLE

# OPTIONAL: Set your SSH public key (used for console connections)
# ssh_public_key = ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# OPTIONAL: Set a desired program to launch for VNC (remote desktop). This
# string will be interpreted by your shell, but first Python's format method
# will replace the following strings:
#   {host}   --> host for VNC connection
#   {port}   --> port for VNC connection
# The default is given below (the KDE remote desktop client), feel free to
# modify it.
vnc_prog = krdc vnc://{host}:{port}

# OPTIONAL: Set a desired program to launch to send a notification for various
# events (wait complete, launch complete, etc). If unset, no notifications are
# sent. This string will be split according to shell lexer rules, and any
# argument which contains {message} will be replaced with the notification
# message.
#
# A Linux example:    notify-send "yo!" {message}
# A Mac OS X example: osascript -e 'display notification "{message}" with title "yo!"'
#
# notify_prog = COMMAND HERE

# OPTIONAL: Configures yo's default behavior on termination. When False (the
# default when not specified), the root block device will be deleted when the
# instance is terminated. Your data is not preserved in any way, and the
# instance cannot be recreated later. When true, the root block device will be
# preserved, so that an instance could later be created using the same root
# device. This configuration option simply sets the default behavior. You may
# override this behavior on the command line of yo terminate with either the
# --preserve-volume -p argument, or the --no-preserve-volume -P argument,
# depending on your configuration value.
#
# Note that these block devices are not free, and disk space in a given tenancy
# is limited. You may be asked to reduce your disk usage if you leave lots of
# block volumes around. Further, yo does not (yet) have commands for managing
# block devices. Once you've terminated an instance, preserving its volume, you
# will need to use other tools to delete it.  Finally, yo does not (yet) have
# support for launching an instance with a given root device. So you'll need to
# use some other tool to use your preserved volumes in this way.
#
# preserve_volume_on_terminate = false

# OPTIONAL: oci_profile
#
# Use this configuration to specify the OCI SDK profile name that yo should use.
#
# oci_profile = DEFAULT

# OPTIONAL: ssh_args
# OPTIONAL: ssh_interactive_args
#
# Use these to customize the SSH commands used.
#
# ssh_interactive_args = -A

# OPTIONAL: task_dir
#
# Specify the directory on OCI instances where yo tasks are copied and in which
# they execute. The default is /tmp/tasks, but in some cases, this may not be
# suitable (e.g. if /tmp is ephemeral). The setting can't be changed on a
# per-instance basis, but it should be good enough.
# The path should be absolute, and your user should have permission to create
# the directory (and parents) if it does not exist.
# Note: shell home directory syntax cannot be used (~/), but you can use
# $HOME instead.
#
# task_dir = /tmp/tasks

# OPTIONAL: exact_name
#
# Globally disables Yo's behavior regarding instance and volume naming.
# Normally, yo prefixes names with your system username, and uses an automatic
# incrementing number as a suffix to avoid name collisions. If this config is
# set to "true", then the behavior is disabled: Yo will never modify the name
# you give.
#
# exact_name = false

# OPTIONAL: check_for_update_every
#
# (Integer, default=6). The minimum number of hours between automatic checks for
# a newer version of Yo.
#
# During each "yo list" operation, if it has been more than this number of hours
# since the previous check, Yo will check in the background for the latest
# version. If there is a newer version, then Yo will print a message about it at
# the end of the operation. Since this occurs in a separate thread during an
# operation which typically takes a few seconds, there's virtually no
# performance impact.
#
# However, you can set this to 0 in order to disable these checks.
#
# check_for_update_every = 6

# OPTIONAL: list_columns
#
# (String, default: Name,Shape,Mem,CPU,State,Created)
#
# A comma-separated list of column names to include in the table for the `yo
# list` command. You can override this on the command line with the `-C`
# argument. You can add to this on the command line with the `-x` argument.
#
# list_columns = Name,Shape,Mem,CPU,State,Created

# OPTIONAL: allow_hash_in_config_value
#
# (Boolean, Optional, Default: false)
#
# By default, Yo detects the '#' character within a configuration value, and
# raises an error, becaues this is a common mistake for users. The '#' character
# can only introduce a comment at the beginning of a line. If you use it after
# a config value, it is included in the resulting value, which is usually not
# what you want. However, if there is some case where you actually want to
# include a hash in the config, set this to true to bypass the error.
#
# allow_hash_in_config_value = false

# OPTIONAL: allow_legacy_imds_endpoints
#
# (Boolean, Optional, Default: false)
#
# The Instance Metadata Service v1 is a less-secure mechanism for OCI to
# retrieve metadata from your instance.  If your images support IMDS v2, then v1
# should be disabled. Since virtually all platform images support v2, it is best
# practice at this point to disable v1.
#
# If this causes issues, then you can either set this configuration to "true" to
# use the less-secure option globally, or you can use the
# ``--allow-legacy-imds-endpoints`` flag for ``yo launch`` to use the
# less-secure option for just one instance.
#
# allow_legacy_imds_endpoints = false

##################################
# OCI Region Configuration
#
# Any section prefixed with "regions." declares a region configuration.
# These sections specify region-specific information: namely, the VCN and
# subnet. The region you are interacting with can be set by the "region"
# configuration in the [yo] section, or on the command line with:
#
#     yo -r REGION ...
#
# You can only use regions which have a corresponding configuration section
# here.
##################################
[regions.us-ashburn-1]

# REQUIRED: VCN ID which contains the subnets your instances should be created
# in.
vcn_id = VCN_ID

## There are two ways to specify a subnet: either specify the subnet_id (most
## common), OR specify a compartment which contains subnets. You must configure
## either subnet_id or subnet_compartment_id.
#
# Option 1: Specify a single subnet ID to use for your instances.
# subnet_id = SUBNET_ID
#
# Option 2: Subnets may change based on which availability domain you're
# operating in. As a result, yo's logic is to list all subnets in the following
# subnet, which belong to the above VCN. If there are multiple, it takes the
# first one.  For sustaining engineers, this is the "Networks" compartment
# below.
# subnet_compartment_id = COMPARTMENT_ID
subnet_id = SUBNET_ID


##################################
# Instance Profile Configuration
#
# Any section prefixed with "instances." declares an instance profile. The
# instance profile DEFAULT is required, but you can make additional ones as
# well.
##################################
[instances.DEFAULT]

# REQUIRED: set the availability domain for this instance.
#
# This should be set as a simple integer. For instance, instead of
# "VkEH:US-ASHBURN-AD-3", simply specify "3". This ensures that your profile
# will work in any region.
#
# Note that for compatibility, Yo does allow you to specify a full string AD
# name. However, if that AD is not found in the region, then Yo will take the
# trailing integer at the end of the AD name, and use that to select a valid AD
# within the region.
#
# If the value specified is less than or equal to zero, then Yo will randomly
# choose an availability domain each time you launch an instance. If the value
# is larger than the number of ADs present in a given region, then Yo will allow
# the index to silently wrap around (e.g. specifying AD 4 in a region with only
# 3 ADs will result in AD 1 being selected).
availability_domain = VkEH:US-ASHBURN-AD-3

# REQUIRED: set the shape for this instance
shape = VM.Standard.x86.Generic

# For flex shapes, this is required: set memory and CPU:
mem = 16

# REQUIRED: set the OS for this instance (OS:version)
# Want to see what OS options are available? Run `yo os`.
os = Oracle Linux:9

# OPTIONAL: set the disk size in GiB.
# boot_volume_size_gbs = 100
#
# Valid values are >=50 and less than or equal to 16384. If unset, then we just
# accept whatever OCI gives us.  NOTE: if you use this, your instance may boot
# with mismatched partition table for the disk size. You may want to use
# `service ocid start` to launch the OCI daemon to tune these things.

# OPTIONAL: set the default name for your instance
# name = ol8-1
# -> Names get automatically prefixed by your username, if they aren't already.
# -> Trailing "-<digits>" gets incremented automatically, if an instance already
#    exists with a given name.
# -> So this would result in instances named "USERNAME-ol8-1", "USERNAME-ol8-2",
#    etc, as you create them.
name = ol9-1

# OPTIONAL: add tasks which are automatically started on instance launch
# tasks = task_a,task_b
#
# Multiple tasks can be joined by a comma, but do not use a space between them.
# Please note that you cannot remove the tasks specified here via the command
# line. For example, running "yo launch -t task_c" with the above tasks
# configuration will result in ALL THREE tasks running. So only place tasks here
# which you will always want running.
#
# In order to start tasks at launch time, yo must wait for an instance to become
# RUNNING, and for SSH to come up. This means that when you configure the tasks
# field, yo will always block waiting for SSH, regardless of whether you pass
# --wait or --ssh at launch time.
#
# The ocid service is provided by all Oracle Linux images, and it will
# automatically do things like resizing partitions and filesystems when you
# expand a block device, or adding newly attached volumes. You should consider
# keeping this configuration so that your experience using OCI is a bit
# smoother!
tasks = ocid

# Instances can inherit from other profiles. Even the DEFAULT profile may
# inherit from something else. They need not set any configuration which a
# parent sets, but anything they do set will override the parent. There may be
# any loops in the inheritance tree, but the depth can be arbitrarily large.

[aliases]
# The aliases section is optional. When provided, it specifies string shortcuts
# for commands. Be careful, as you could overwrite an existing command here. If
# you do not specify an aliases section at all (or if it is empty), then yo will
# simply allow you to use any non-ambiguous prefix as an alias/shortcut for a
# command name. But beware, as new sub-commands are added to yo, the
# non-ambiguous prefixes may change and disrupt your muscle memory.
