This module allows to apply putaway strategies to the products resulting
from the manufacturing orders.

The finished products will be placed in the location designated by the
putaway strategy (if they do not have another destination move), based
on the finished products location that was defined in the manufacturing
order.

Configuration
=============

To configure a putaway strategy follow the next steps:

1. Go to 'Inventory / Settings'. Activate the option 'Multi-Step Routes'
   and save.
2. Go again to 'Inventory / Settings' and press 'Set Putaway Strategies
   on Locations'. Then define a putaway strategy in the location zone
   where the finished products are supposed to be placed, and indicate
   the specific sub-location/bin where the products should be placed.

Usage
=====

To use this module proceed as follows:

1. Create a manufacturing order and indicate the product and the
   finished products location zone.
2. Confirm the manufacturing order.
3. You will notice that the finished products location has changed to
   the putaway location, and the chatter shows a message indicating that
   the putaway strategy was applied.
