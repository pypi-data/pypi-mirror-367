# Tutorial: Error Handling and Compensations

Learn how to build resilient workflows with proper error handling, compensations, and recovery patterns.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will:
- Implement the saga pattern with compensations
- Handle different types of errors gracefully
- Build workflows that can recover from failures
- Understand rollback and cleanup strategies
- Test error scenarios systematically

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Basic Workflow Tutorial](basic-workflow.md)
- Understanding of distributed transaction concepts
- Familiarity with async error handling in Python

## What We're Building

An **Order Processing Workflow** with comprehensive error handling:

1. **Reserve Inventory** (with compensation: release inventory)
2. **Charge Payment** (with compensation: refund payment)  
3. **Create Shipment** (with compensation: cancel shipment)
4. **Send Confirmation** (no compensation needed)

If any step fails, compensations run in reverse order to undo previous actions.

## Error Handling Patterns

### 1. Input Validation Errors
- Catch early before any resources are allocated
- Return clear error messages
- Don't trigger compensations

### 2. Resource Allocation Errors  
- Handle partial failures gracefully
- Clean up allocated resources immediately
- May or may not trigger workflow compensations

### 3. External Service Errors
- Distinguish between retryable and non-retryable errors
- Implement proper timeout handling
- Use compensations to undo completed actions

### 4. System Errors
- Handle unexpected failures gracefully
- Ensure compensations still execute
- Log detailed error context

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

Create `order_processing_with_errors.py`:

```python
import asyncio
import random
import time
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

from multiagents import worker
from multiagents.core.factory import create_simple_framework
from multiagents.orchestrator.workflow import WorkflowBuilder
from multiagents.core.exceptions import WorkerExecutionError

# Custom exception types
class InsufficientInventoryError(Exception):
    """Raised when there's not enough inventory."""
    pass

class PaymentDeclinedError(Exception):
    """Raised when payment is declined."""
    pass

class ShippingUnavailableError(Exception):
    """Raised when shipping is not available."""
    pass

# Simulate external service states
INVENTORY_DB = {
    "LAPTOP-001": 5,
    "MOUSE-001": 20,
    "KEYBOARD-001": 0,  # Out of stock
    "MONITOR-001": 3
}

PAYMENT_SERVICE_STATUS = "online"  # Can be "online", "offline", "degraded"
SHIPPING_SERVICE_STATUS = "online"

# Track reservations and transactions for cleanup
ACTIVE_RESERVATIONS = {}
ACTIVE_PAYMENTS = {}
ACTIVE_SHIPMENTS = {}
```

## Step 5: Confirmation Worker (No Compensation)

```python

    order_id = context["order_id"]
    customer_email = context.get("customer_email", "customer@example.com")
    tracking_number = context.get("tracking_number", "N/A")

        .add_step("send_confirmation", "send_confirmation")
        # No compensation for confirmation - emails can't be "unsent"
        .build())
```

üèÅ Final Result: COMPENSATED

## Understanding Compensation Flow

When the payment fails in the third scenario:

1. **Inventory Reserved**: Successfully reserved 1 monitor
2. **Payment Failed**: Payment was declined
3. **Compensation Triggered**: Workflow enters compensation mode
4. **Inventory Released**: `release_inventory` compensation executed
5. **Final State**: Workflow marked as "compensated"

## Step 9: Advanced Error Scenarios

Add these functions to test more complex scenarios:

```python
async def simulate_service_outages(orchestrator):
    """Test behavior during service outages."""
    global PAYMENT_SERVICE_STATUS, SHIPPING_SERVICE_STATUS
    
    print("\nüîß Testing Service Outage Scenarios")
    
    # Test payment service outage
    print("\nüì¥ Simulating payment service outage...")
    PAYMENT_SERVICE_STATUS = "offline"
    
    try:
        transaction_id = await orchestrator.execute_workflow(
            "order_processing_with_compensations",
            {
                "order_id": "ORDER-PAYMENT-OUTAGE",
                "order_items": [{"product_id": "LAPTOP-001", "quantity": 1}],
                "payment_info": {"method": "credit_card"},
                "total_amount": 999.99,
                "customer_email": "test@example.com"
            }
        )
        
        # Monitor result
        while True:
            status = await orchestrator.get_status(transaction_id)
            if status['state'] in {"completed", "failed", "compensated"}:
                print(f"Payment outage result: {status['state']}")
                break
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
            
    finally:
        # Restore service
        PAYMENT_SERVICE_STATUS = "online"
        print("üì∂ Payment service restored")

async def test_partial_compensation_failure():
    """Test scenarios where compensations themselves might fail."""
    # This could involve temporarily breaking compensation workers
    # to see how the system handles compensation failures
    pass
```

## Verification

### Check Compensation Effectiveness

1. **Resource Cleanup**: Verify inventory is properly released
2. **Payment Handling**: Ensure refunds are processed
3. **Shipment Management**: Confirm shipments are cancelled
4. **State Consistency**: Check that final state reflects compensation

### Test Edge Cases

1. **Multiple Failures**: What happens if both payment and shipping fail?
2. **Compensation Failures**: What if a compensation worker itself fails?
3. **Partial Success**: How are partial inventory reservations handled?
4. **Service Outages**: How does the system behave during outages?

## Common Issues

### Compensation Not Executing
- Check that compensation workers are registered
- Verify compensation names match in workflow definition
- Ensure earlier steps succeeded before compensation is needed

### Resource Leaks
- Make sure compensation workers properly clean up resources
- Check for race conditions in resource allocation/deallocation
- Monitor active resource tracking dictionaries

### Error Propagation
- Distinguish between retryable and non-retryable errors
- Ensure worker errors are properly categorized
- Check that validation errors don't trigger unnecessary compensations

‚úÖ **Error Categories**: Different types of errors and how to handle them  
‚úÖ **Compensation Design**: How to build effective rollback mechanisms  
‚úÖ **Resource Management**: Proper allocation and cleanup of resources  
‚úÖ **Error Propagation**: How errors flow through workflows  
‚úÖ **Testing Strategies**: How to systematically test error scenarios  

## Next Steps

Continue your learning journey with:

1. **[Monitoring Setup Tutorial](monitoring-setup.md)** - Add observability to error-prone workflows
2. **[DSPy Workers Tutorial](dspy-workers.md)** - Build intelligent error handling with LLMs
3. **[Advanced Patterns Tutorial](advanced-patterns.md)** - Implement retry policies and circuit breakers

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Design for Failure**: Assume external services will fail
2. **Fail Fast**: Validate early to avoid unnecessary resource allocation  
3. **Clean Compensations**: Make compensation workers idempotent and robust
4. **Detailed Logging**: Log all error scenarios with sufficient context
5. **Monitor Resources**: Track active resources to detect leaks
6. **Test Thoroughly**: Create comprehensive error scenario test suites

This tutorial demonstrates how to build resilient, production-ready workflows that gracefully handle failures and maintain system consistency!
