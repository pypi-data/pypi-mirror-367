## 🎯 Purpose

This journal serves to:
- **Track Implementation Progress**: Daily logs of development activities
- **Document Decisions**: Architecture and design choices with rationale
- **Record Challenges**: Problems encountered and solutions found
- **Maintain Context**: Historical context for future development
- **Share Knowledge**: Team learning and best practices

## 📋 Usage Guidelines

### Daily Development Logs
1. Create a new file for each development day: `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-log.md`
2. Use the daily log template from `templates/daily_log_template.md`
3. Record what was worked on, decisions made, and blockers encountered
4. Place in the appropriate monthly directory

### Feature Implementation Logs
1. For significant features, create a dedicated log: `feature-[name]-log.md`
2. Use the feature log template from `templates/feature_log_template.md`
3. Track the entire lifecycle from planning to completion
4. Include design decisions, implementation notes, and testing results

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
1. For significant architectural decisions, create an ADR
2. Use the decision log template from `templates/decision_log_template.md`
3. Follow the format: Context, Decision, Consequences
4. Number sequentially: ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.

## 🏷️ Naming Conventions

### Daily Logs
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-log.md`
- Example: `2024-01-15-daily-log.md`

### Feature Logs
- Format: `feature-[kebab-case-name]-log.md`
- Example: `feature-diagram-generator-log.md`

### Decision Logs
- Format: `ADR-XXX-[kebab-case-title].md`
- Example: `ADR-001-event-driven-architecture.md`

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Each log should include:
- **Status**: Not Started, In Progress, Review, Complete, Blocked
- **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
- **Effort**: Time estimates and actual time spent
- **Dependencies**: What this depends on or blocks
- **Decisions**: Key choices made during implementation

## 🔗 Integration with Backlog

This journal complements the main `BACKLOG.md` by providing:
- Detailed implementation notes for backlog items
- Historical context for decisions
- Lessons learned during development
- Reference for future similar work

## 📝 Templates

All templates are located in the `templates/` directory and provide:
- Consistent structure across all logs
- Required sections for thorough documentation
- Prompts for important information
- Examples and guidelines

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Copy the appropriate template from `templates/`
2. Fill in the sections with relevant information
3. Save in the correct directory with proper naming
4. Update regularly to maintain accuracy
5. Reference in commit messages and PRs when relevant
