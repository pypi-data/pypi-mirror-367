# ADR-001: Event-Driven Architecture for Framework Communication

**Date**: 2024-01-01  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Development Team  
**Consulted**: Framework Users  
**Informed**: All Stakeholders

---

## 📝 Summary

Adopt an event-driven architecture using publish-subscribe pattern for all communication between framework components.

---

## 🎯 Context and Problem Statement

### Background
The MultiAgents Framework needs to coordinate between multiple components (orchestrator, workers, monitoring) in a distributed system. Traditional synchronous communication creates tight coupling and scalability bottlenecks.

### Problem Statement
How should framework components communicate with each other to ensure:
- Loose coupling between components
- Scalability to handle many concurrent workflows
- Reliability and fault tolerance
- Easy monitoring and observability

### Goals and Requirements
- Goal 1: Enable horizontal scaling of framework components
- Goal 2: Minimize coupling between orchestrator and workers
- Goal 3: Support reliable message delivery and processing
- Requirement 1: Must handle high message throughput (1000+ messages/sec)
- Requirement 2: Must provide message ordering guarantees for workflows
- Requirement 3: Must support at-least-once delivery semantics

### Constraints
- Must work with existing Python ecosystem
- Should minimize external dependencies
- Must support both local development and distributed deployment
- Budget constraint: prefer open-source solutions

---

## 🔍 Decision Drivers

- **Scalability**: Need to scale orchestrator and workers independently
- **Decoupling**: Orchestrator shouldn't know about specific worker instances
- **Reliability**: Messages must not be lost during processing
- **Observability**: Need to track message flow for debugging
- **Simplicity**: Development team has limited distributed systems experience
- **Performance**: Sub-second workflow step execution times required

---

## 🛠️ Considered Options

### Option 1: Direct HTTP API Calls
**Description**: Orchestrator makes HTTP calls directly to worker endpoints

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple to understand and implement
- ✅ Standard REST patterns well-known by team
- ✅ Easy debugging with standard HTTP tools

**Cons**:
- ❌ Tight coupling between orchestrator and workers
- ❌ Difficult to scale workers dynamically
- ❌ No built-in retry or reliability mechanisms
- ❌ Worker discovery and load balancing complexity

**Effort**: Low  
**Risk**: Medium

### Option 2: Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Apache Kafka)
**Description**: Use enterprise message queue for async communication

**Pros**:
- ✅ Battle-tested enterprise solution
- ✅ Built-in reliability and durability
- ✅ Advanced routing and scaling features
- ✅ Strong ordering and delivery guarantees

**Cons**:
- ❌ High complexity for development team
- ❌ Additional infrastructure to manage
- ❌ Steeper learning curve
- ❌ May be overkill for initial use cases

**Effort**: High  
**Risk**: Medium

### Option 3: Redis Pub/Sub with Event Bus Abstraction
**Description**: Use Redis pub/sub with abstraction layer for future flexibility

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple to implement and understand
- ✅ Redis already familiar to team
- ✅ Good performance for initial scale
- ✅ Event bus abstraction allows future migration
- ✅ Built-in persistence options with Redis

**Cons**:
- ❌ Redis pub/sub has limited durability guarantees
- ❌ May need migration for very high scale
- ❌ Less enterprise features than dedicated queues

**Effort**: Medium  
**Risk**: Low

---

## ✅ Decision Outcome

### Chosen Option
**Selected**: Option 3 - Redis Pub/Sub with Event Bus Abstraction

### Rationale
1. **Learning Curve**: Team already familiar with Redis, minimizing risk
2. **Abstraction Layer**: Event bus interface allows future migration to other solutions
3. **Performance**: Redis pub/sub meets initial performance requirements
4. **Simplicity**: Balances power with implementation complexity
5. **Development Speed**: Faster initial implementation than enterprise queues

### Decision Criteria Evaluation
| Criteria | HTTP API | Message Queue | Redis Pub/Sub | Winner |
|----------|----------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Implementation Speed | 9/10 | 4/10 | 7/10 | HTTP API |
| Scalability | 3/10 | 9/10 | 7/10 | Message Queue |
| Team Expertise | 8/10 | 3/10 | 8/10 | Tie |
| Reliability | 4/10 | 9/10 | 6/10 | Message Queue |
| Flexibility | 2/10 | 8/10 | 7/10 | Message Queue |
| **Weighted Score** | **5.2** | **6.6** | **7.0** | **Redis Pub/Sub** |

## 📈 Expected Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- ✅ Loose coupling enables independent scaling of components
- ✅ Event-driven pattern naturally supports workflow orchestration
- ✅ Built-in support for monitoring and observability
- ✅ Redis clustering provides horizontal scaling path
- ✅ Abstraction allows migration to other message systems

### Negative Consequences
- ❌ Redis pub/sub doesn't guarantee message durability by default
- ❌ May need to implement custom reliability patterns
- ❌ Debugging distributed flows more complex than synchronous calls
- ❌ Potential message ordering issues in high-concurrency scenarios

### Neutral Consequences
- ➖ Team needs to learn event-driven programming patterns
- ➖ Additional infrastructure component (Redis) to manage

## 🔄 Implementation Plan

### Immediate Actions
1. **Design Event Bus Interface**: Create abstraction for publish/subscribe operations
2. **Implement Redis Backend**: Redis pub/sub implementation of event bus
3. **Define Event Schema**: Standard event format with metadata for tracing

### Timeline
- **Week 1**: Event bus interface and Redis implementation
- **Week 2**: Integration with orchestrator and worker manager
- **Week 3**: Monitoring and observability integration

### Success Metrics
- **Throughput**: Handle 1000+ events per second
- **Latency**: Sub-100ms event delivery
- **Reliability**: 99.9% message delivery success rate

---

## 📊 Validation and Monitoring

### Validation Approach
- **Load Testing**: Simulate high event throughput scenarios
- **Fault Injection**: Test behavior during Redis failures
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow execution validation

### Monitoring Plan
- **Event Throughput**: Messages per second by event type
- **Event Latency**: Time from publish to processing
- **Error Rates**: Failed message delivery percentage
- **Queue Depth**: Pending message counts

### Review Schedule
- **Short-term Review**: 1 month after implementation
- **Long-term Review**: 6 months after production deployment
- **Trigger Events**: Performance issues or reliability problems
