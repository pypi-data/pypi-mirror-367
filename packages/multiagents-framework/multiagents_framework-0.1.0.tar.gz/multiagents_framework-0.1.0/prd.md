Product Requirements Document: Hybrid Event-Driven Orchestration Framework
Version: 1.1

Status: Draft

Author: Product Team

Date: August 2, 2025

1. Introduction
   1.1. Problem Statement
   Developing complex, stateful applications like conversational AI agents, e-commerce backends, or multi-step business workflows presents a significant architectural challenge. Monolithic systems lack scalability, while purely choreographed microservices make it difficult to track, debug, and manage the overall state of a business process. This leads to brittle systems, complex inter-service dependencies, and a poor developer experience.

1.2. Vision & Solution
This document proposes the creation of a Hybrid Event-Driven Orchestration Framework. The vision is to provide developers with a robust, scalable, and intuitive framework for building intelligent, multi-step, and fault-tolerant applications.

The solution is based on a core philosophy of separating the what from the how:

The "What" (Logic): Business logic and workflow decisions are centralized in a stateful Orchestrator.

The "How" (Communication): Communication between all components is handled asynchronously and is decoupled through an Event Bus.

This hybrid model provides the centralized intelligence of orchestration with the resilience and scalability of event-driven choreography.

2. Goals and Objectives
   Primary Goal: To enable the rapid development of complex, stateful, event-driven applications while ensuring high performance, scalability, and maintainability.

Key Objectives:

Simplify Workflow Management: Abstract the complexity of distributed workflows into a central, easy-to-define Orchestrator.

Promote Decoupling: Ensure all services (Orchestrator and Workers) are fully decoupled via the Event Bus.

Enhance Developer Experience: Provide a simple SDK for creating workers and a clear method for defining workflows.

Ensure Resilience: The system must be fault-tolerant, handling transient failures and providing a clear path for compensating failed transactions.

Enable Scalability: All components of the framework must be horizontally scalable to handle high-volume workloads.

Support Composability: The architecture must naturally support hierarchical composition, where a "Worker Agent" can itself be a multi-agent swarm.

3. Target Audience & Use Cases
   Target Audience: Software Developers and Architects building distributed systems.

Primary Use Cases:

Conversational AI: Multi-turn dialogue systems for booking, customer support, or task automation.

Business Process Automation: E-commerce order fulfillment, loan application processing, supply chain management.

IoT & Data Pipelines: Complex, multi-stage data ingestion and processing workflows.

4. Functional Requirements (Features)
   4.1. Core Components
   Orchestrator Service (The "Brain")

FR-1.1: Must manage the state of each long-running transaction (the "Saga Context"). The state must be persisted to a durable store (e.g., Redis, PostgreSQL) to survive restarts.

FR-1.2: Must provide an API for developers to define a workflow as a state machine (e.g., via a programmatic builder in code or a declarative JSON/YAML format).

FR-1.3: Must initiate actions by publishing Command Events to the Event Bus.

FR-1.4: Must subscribe to and process Result Events from the Event Bus to drive the state machine forward.

FR-1.5: The workflow definition must include explicit steps for handling failures and triggering corresponding Compensating Transactions.

Worker Agent SDK (The "Specialists")

FR-2.1: The framework must provide an SDK (e.g., a Python library) to simplify the creation of Worker Agents.

FR-2.2: The SDK must provide a simple API for a worker to subscribe to a specific Command Event.

FR-2.3: The SDK must provide a simple API for a worker to publish a Result Event.

FR-2.4: Workers built with the SDK must be stateless regarding the overall workflow.

Event Bus Abstraction (The "Nervous System")

FR-3.1: The framework must include an internal abstraction layer for interacting with the message broker.

FR-3.2: The initial implementation must support Redis Pub/Sub as the default transport for ease of development. The design must allow for future integration of other brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

4.2. Key Features
FR-4.1: Transaction Tracing: All events published within the framework must automatically carry a unique transaction_id and a correlation_id to allow for end-to-end tracing of a single workflow.

FR-4.2: Hierarchical Orchestration: The framework must inherently support "teams of teams." A component registered as a Worker Agent must be able to act as its own Orchestrator for a sub-process, without the parent Orchestrator needing to be aware of the internal complexity.

FR-4.3: Idempotency: Worker agents should be designed to handle potential duplicate command events gracefully, ensuring an operation is not incorrectly performed multiple times.

FR-4.4: Event Schema Definition: Provide an optional mechanism for defining and validating the schema of events to prevent data inconsistencies between services.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
   NFR-1: Performance: The system must be designed for low-latency communication. Event processing should be highly efficient to support real-time applications.

NFR-2: Scalability: The Orchestrator and Worker Agents must be designed to be stateless (with state externalized to a database/cache), allowing for horizontal scaling.

NFR-3: Reliability: The framework must guarantee "at-least-once" delivery for events. The Orchestrator's state persistence must be durable.

NFR-4: Observability: The framework should provide hooks for logging, metrics, and tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to give developers visibility into running processes.

6. Roadmap (MVP)
   Phase 1: Core Engine (Target: 1 Month)

Develop the Orchestrator service with persistent state management using Redis.

Develop the Python Worker Agent SDK.

Implement the Event Bus abstraction with Redis Pub/Sub.

Create a simple "e-commerce order" example to validate the end-to-end flow.

Phase 2: Production Readiness (Target: 3 Months)

Implement robust error handling and compensating transaction logic.

Add comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and API references.

Implement foundational observability hooks for logging and tracing.

Conduct performance and load testing.

Phase 3: Advanced Features (Target: 6 Months)

Develop and test the hierarchical orchestration (swarm) capability.

Add support for a second Event Bus provider (e.g., RabbitMQ).

Create a visualizer tool to display the state of active sagas.

7. Success Metrics
   Developer Velocity: Time required for a developer to build a standard 3-step workflow.

System Performance: Average event processing latency under load.

Adoption: Number of internal projects actively using the framework.

Reliability: System uptime and percentage of successfully completed transactions.
