- [x] Multi-location environment file search (.env, ~/.multiagents.env, system-wide)
- [x] Flexible API credential loading with multiple environment variable names
- [x] Created comprehensive setup documentation (SETUP.md) 

### 🌐 Real Web Search Integration

## 🧠 Key Decisions Made

1. **LLM-Driven Orchestration**: Made coordinator fully LLM-powered instead of rule-based routing
   - **Reasoning**: Provides much more intelligent and contextual routing decisions
   - **Impact**: Enables natural conversation handling and sophisticated intent detection

2. **Dual-Phase LLM Analysis**: Implemented intent detection → routing decision flow
   - **Reasoning**: Separates conversation detection from research routing for better accuracy
   - **Impact**: Handles edge cases and ambiguous inputs more gracefully

3. **Multi-Location Environment Configuration**: Supports .env, ~/.multiagents.env, system-wide
   - **Reasoning**: Makes package work seamlessly in development, pip, and production scenarios
   - **Impact**: Production-ready configuration system that "just works"

4. **Conversational Response Integration**: Built into coordinator rather than separate service
   - **Reasoning**: Tighter integration and consistent LLM context
   - **Impact**: More coherent and contextually appropriate responses

## 🔍 Learning & Discoveries

- **LLM Intent Detection**: DSPy's predict() method works excellently for intent analysis and routing decisions
- **Multi-Modal Responses**: Same LLM can handle both conversational and research coordination intelligently  
- **Configuration Complexity**: Pip-installable packages need sophisticated environment variable loading
- **Graceful Degradation**: Multiple fallback layers ensure system works even when APIs fail
- **CLI User Experience**: Conversational responses need different formatting than research results

## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Resolved

| Issue | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Conversational Detection | Simple rule-based routing couldn't distinguish greetings from research | Implemented LLM-driven intent analysis with dual-phase processing |
| Environment Variables | API keys not loading in pip scenarios | Created robust multi-location environment file search with project root detection |
| CLI Response Formatting | Conversational responses looked like research results | Added specialized formatting with suggested actions and topics |
| Workflow Integration | Simple workflow didn't support conversational routing | Updated both simple_workflow.py and workflow.py with conversational handling |
| Fallback Mechanisms | System broke when LLM predictions failed | Added comprehensive fallback logic at multiple levels |

## 💭 Notes & Reflections

This was a breakthrough session that transformed the Smart Research Assistant from a basic research tool into an intelligent conversational AI system. The key insight was making the coordinator fully LLM-driven rather than rule-based, which enables much more sophisticated and natural interactions.

The dual-phase LLM analysis (intent detection → routing) works exceptionally well and handles edge cases that would be impossible with traditional rule-based systems. Users can now interact naturally with greetings, help requests, and research queries seamlessly.

The production-ready configuration system ensures the framework works seamlessly whether in development, as a pip-installed package, or in production deployments. This is crucial for real-world adoption.

**Major Achievement**: Successfully demonstrated that LLM-driven orchestration can intelligently route between different interaction modes (conversational vs research) while maintaining high-quality responses in both scenarios.
