PERMANENT DEPENDENCY MEMORY TEST - READ THIS EVERY TIME

🚨 CRITICAL: This test exists because we keep forgetting about the 
pyproject.toml vs setup.py dependency issue and it breaks user installations.

🚨 THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES:
- We add dependencies to setup.py
- We forget pyproject.toml overrides setup.py  
- Dependencies missing from final package
- Users get "ModuleNotFoundError" at runtime
- System appears broken ("0 findings")

🚨 ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED July 2, 2025:
Modern Python packaging (pip 21.3+, build tools) prioritizes pyproject.toml 
over setup.py. If pyproject.toml has a [project] dependencies section, 
it COMPLETELY OVERRIDES setup.py install_requires.

🚨 SOLUTION:
ALWAYS add dependencies to BOTH files or use only pyproject.toml.
