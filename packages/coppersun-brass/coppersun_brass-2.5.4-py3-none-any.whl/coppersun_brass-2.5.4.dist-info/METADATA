# Copper Sun Brass

> 🧠 Development Intelligence for AI Agents

Copper Sun Brass is an AI advisory system that acts as a "General Staff" for AI agents (like Claude Code) working on software projects. It provides persistent memory, project analysis, and intelligence gathering.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Command Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Install and activate trial in one command
curl -fsSL https://brass.coppersun.dev/setup | bash

# Navigate to your project and initialize
cd your-project
brass init
```

### Standard Installation
```bash
# Install from PyPI (recommended: pipx for isolated environment)
pipx install coppersun-brass

# Generate and activate 15-day trial
brass generate-trial --activate

# Configure Claude API (required)
brass config set claude_api_key sk-your-api-key

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
brass init
```

### Check Status
```bash
# Verify everything is working
brass status

# Get AI insights for your project
brass insights

# View legal documents
brass legal
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### Four Specialized Agents

1. **Watch Agent** 👁️ - Continuous project monitoring
2. **Scout Agent** 🔍 - Deep code analysis and pattern detection  
3. **Strategist Agent** 🎯 - High-level planning and recommendations
4. **Planner Agent** 📋 - Task generation and prioritization

### Core Capabilities

- **Persistent Memory** 💾 - Maintains context across AI sessions
- **Strategic Planning** 📊 - Project analysis and recommendations
- **Pattern Detection** 🔍 - Identifies code patterns and potential issues
- **File System Monitoring** 📡 - Tracks file changes in real-time
- **Code Intelligence** 🧠 - Security detection and architecture insights
- **External Integration Framework** 🔗 - Ready for Slack, GitHub, webhooks (coming soon)
- **Privacy-First** 🔒 - All data stays local on your machine

## 💡 How It Works

Copper Sun Brass creates a `.brass/` directory in your project containing:
- **Project context** that persists across AI sessions
- **Continuous analysis** by four specialized AI agents
- **Strategic insights** and recommendations
- **Development patterns** and best practices

When you work with Claude Code (or other AI assistants), they can access this context to provide much better, more informed assistance.

## 📖 Documentation

### Essential Commands
```bash
brass status        # Check system status
brass init          # Initialize project
brass insights      # Get AI recommendations  
brass refresh       # Update project analysis
brass scout scan    # Scan for code issues
brass legal         # View legal documents
brass --help        # See all commands
```

## 🌟 Why Copper Sun Brass?

Traditional development tools are stateless. AI agents forget context between sessions. Copper Sun Brass solves this by providing:

1. **Persistent Intelligence** - Never lose context between AI sessions
2. **Strategic Thinking** - Goes beyond syntax checking to architectural insights
3. **Adaptive Learning** - Improves understanding of your project over time
4. **AI-Native Design** - Built specifically for AI coding assistants
