# opfo
opfo **O**ver**P**owerd**F**ile**O**rganizer is an advanced file organizer implemented in python

> [!NOTE]
> *the app is only available on Linux and MacOs*

## what it does:
opfo is a file organizer that organizes your file based on their extension and path set to in the config file located at
*~/.opfo/opfo.json* there are defaults when you first run the application for common file extensions and the paths they
may locate to

## default config:

| extension | default path |
| --------- | ------------ |
| .png      | ~/Pictures   |
| .jpg      | ~/Pictures   |
| .txt      | ~/Documents  |
| .mp4      | ~/Videos     |


> [!NOTE]
> *if any of these paths is not available it won't be added to your default config, and all these could be*
> *modified manually inside of the config file as discussed*

## configuration:
configuring this tool is very easy, but it has some simple rules to follow, first of all the config file is located 
at *~/.opfo/opfo.json* the configuration is written like this:


`<.extension>: <path/to/extension/>`


for example:

    {
        .png: /home/<user>/Pictures,
        .md: /home/<user>/Documents
    }

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *extensions are only valid if they start with a . so you can't write png that won't be accepted, write .png*
> *its also important to write absolute paths not relative or ~ for home/user you have to write it yourself*

some things that may make your config invalid:
- you have the path pointing to a file not a directory `/home/<user>/Pictures/pic.png`
- the path you are pointing to doesn't exist `i/do/not/exist`

> [!TIP]
> *if you deleted a folder that was pointed to in the config make sure to change it or that would result in an error*
> *which is why it is recommended to run [`--check`](#the-check-option) anytime you change something related to the config*

## the check option:
the `--check` option allows you to check the configuration on wether its valid or not, this option
runs automatically when you try to organize the fles, but you could run it alone without organizing the files

> [!TIP]
> *it is recommended to run this option before organizing the files, but it is not enforeced*

once the option is ran through

    opfo --check/-c

it should log `[ INFO ] All Good!` if nothing was wrong with the config, it will log good info on any issue in the config
like the extension that has the error or the path related to it so read the logs if you encounter anything wrong!

## the organization:
running

    opfo

will loop through all files in the current working directory and through your config it will know what extensions should go
to what path, and the command will actually run [`--check`](#the-check-option) option in the background and if it detects any
issues with the config it will log those issues and exit, until they are fixed no file organization will happen


the application doesn't go through hidden files as well only non-hidden


if you want to see logs on what is happening in the organization run

    opfo --verbose/-v

which will log useful insight like
- `[ INFO ] pic.png moved to ~/Pictures dir` for moved files that were included in the config (will be printed in green)
- `[ WARNING ] extension .tar is not supported in the config` if it encountered a file with an extension that wasn't in the config (will be printed in orange)

> [!TIP]
> *it is recommended to run with `-v` if you changed the config right before since it will show you if you wrote the paths*
> *to the extensions correctly and if there are other extensions that could be added*

## installation:
the app is available on PyPI run

    pip/pipx install opfo

> [!TIP]
> *it is recommended to use pipx and not pip because it is better for CLI tools, also pip will install the cli tool as a python library*
> *which it isn't*
