## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL with read replicas for user management.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- ACID compliance ensures data consistency
- Mature ecosystem with excellent tooling
- Strong performance for complex queries
- Good integration with our Python stack

**Negative:**
- Additional operational complexity for replica management

## 🧪 Testing and Quality Standards

### Test-Driven Development Process
1. **Red Phase**: Write failing test first
   ```python
   def test_jwt_token_validation():
       """Test that valid JWT tokens are accepted."""
       token = generate_test_token()
       result = validate_jwt_token(token)
       assert result.is_valid is True
       assert result.user_id == "test_user_123"
   ```

2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass test
   ```python
   def validate_jwt_token(token):
       """Validate JWT token and return validation result."""
       try:
           payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
           return ValidationResult(is_valid=True, user_id=payload["user_id"])
       except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
           return ValidationResult(is_valid=False, user_id=None)
   ```

3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code while keeping tests green
   ```python
   def validate_jwt_token(token):
       """Validate JWT token and return validation result.
       
       Args:
           token (str): JWT token to validate
           
       Returns:
           ValidationResult: Contains validation status and user info
           
       Raises:
           ValueError: If token format is invalid
       """
       if not token or not isinstance(token, str):
           raise ValueError("Token must be a non-empty string")
           
       try:
           payload = jwt.decode(
               token, 
               settings.JWT_SECRET_KEY, 
               algorithms=[settings.JWT_ALGORITHM]
           )
           
           # Check token expiration
           if payload.get("exp", 0) < time.time():
               return ValidationResult(is_valid=False, error="Token expired")
               
           return ValidationResult(
               is_valid=True, 
               user_id=payload.get("user_id"),
               permissions=payload.get("permissions", [])
           )
           
       except jwt.InvalidTokenError as e:
           logger.warning(f"Invalid JWT token: {str(e)}")
           return ValidationResult(is_valid=False, error=str(e))
   ```

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy
```python
# Unit Tests - Test individual functions and methods

    def test_malformed_token_rejected(self):
        """Test that malformed tokens are rejected."""
        pass
        
    def test_empty_token_raises_error(self):
        """Test that empty tokens raise ValueError."""
        pass

# Integration Tests - Test component interactions
class TestAuthenticationFlow:
    def test_login_returns_valid_token(self):
        """Test complete login flow returns valid JWT."""
        pass
        
    def test_protected_route_requires_valid_token(self):
        """Test that protected routes validate tokens."""
        pass

# End-to-End Tests - Test complete user scenarios
def test_user_authentication_journey():
    """Test complete user authentication journey."""
    # User registers -> receives confirmation -> logs in -> accesses protected resource
    pass
```

# Create comprehensive bug report
gh issue create --title "[BUG] User authentication fails with special characters in password" --body "## 🐛 Bug Description
Users cannot log in when their password contains special characters (!, @, #, $, %).

## 🔄 Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to login page (https://app.example.com/login)
2. Enter valid email: user@example.com
3. Enter password with special chars: MyP@ssw0rd!
4. Click 'Login' button
5. Observe error message

## ✅ Expected Behavior
User should be successfully authenticated and redirected to dashboard.

## ❌ Actual Behavior
Error message appears: 'Invalid credentials' even with correct password.

## 🌍 Environment
- **Browser**: Chrome 119.0.6045.105
- **OS**: macOS 14.1
- **App Version**: v2.1.3
- **Test Account**: qa-test-user@example.com

## 📸 Evidence
[Screenshot of error message]

## 🔍 Additional Investigation
- Issue occurs with passwords containing: !, @, #, $, %
- Issue does NOT occur with alphanumeric passwords
- Same behavior observed in Firefox and Safari
- Network tab shows 400 Bad Request response

## 📊 Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: High (blocks user authentication)
- **Frequency**: Affects ~30% of users based on password patterns
- **Workaround**: Users can reset password to avoid special chars

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria for Fix
- [ ] Users can authenticate with special characters in passwords
- [ ] All existing password patterns continue to work
- [ ] Proper error handling for actual invalid credentials
- [ ] Unit tests added for password validation scenarios" --label "type:bug,priority:high,severity:high"
