PyWavelets 1.7.0 Release Notes
==============================

We are very pleased to announce the release of PyWavelets 1.7.0. This release
is a minor update to 1.6.x. It adds support for Python 3.13, including for
free-threaded CPython. The supported NumPy and Cython versions are unchanged
from 1.6.x.

Note that building from source with free-threaded CPython requires a recent
development version of Cython (>=3.1.0a0).

Other noteworthy improvements:

- Most examples in the documentation are now interactive, powered by
  JupyterLite and Pyodide.
- The ``musllinux`` wheels were upgraded from ``musllinux_1_1`` to
  ``musllinux_1_2`` (for both x86-64 and aarch64).
