PyWavelets 0.5.1 Release Notes
==============================

PyWavelets 0.5.1 is a bug-fix release with no new features compared to 0.5.0


Bugs Fixed
==========

In release 0.5.0 the wrong edge mode was used for the following three
deprecated modes: ``ppd``, ``sp1``, and ``per``.  All deprecated edge mode
names are now correctly converted to the corresponding new names.

One-dimensional discrete wavelet transforms did not properly respect the
``axis`` argument for complex-valued data.  Prior to this release, the last
axis was always transformed for arrays with complex dtype.  This fix affects
``dwt``, ``idwt``, ``wavedec``, ``waverec``.
