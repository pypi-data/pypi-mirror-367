# bond_angle_scan calculation style

## Introduction

The bond_angle_scan calculation style evaluates the interaction energy between three atoms at varying distances and angles.  This provides a means of characterizing the three-body interactions of a given potential.  These interactions can provide insight into the bonding predictions for a potential as well as a means of fingerprinting the potentials.
