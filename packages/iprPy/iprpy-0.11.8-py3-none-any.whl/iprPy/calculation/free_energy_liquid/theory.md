## Method and Theory

The calculation performs two different simulations: an nvt simulation to estimate Einstein solid spring constants for each atom type, and thermodynamic integrations from the selected interatomic potential to the Einstein solid model and back.  The method follows what is described in [Freitas, Asta, de Koning, Computational Materials Science 112 (2016) 333â€“341](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2015.10.050).

The Einstein solid spring constants, $k_i$, are evaluated using an nvt simulation run and measuring the mean squared displacements, $\left<\left( \Delta r_i \right)^2\right>$, averaged for each atom type $i$ and over time

$$ k_i = \frac{3 k_B T}{\left<\left( \Delta r_i \right)^2\right>} $$

For the integration, TBD...
