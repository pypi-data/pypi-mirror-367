# relax_box calculation style

## Introduction

The free_energy_liquid calculation style uses thermodynamic integration to evaluate the absolute Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies of a liquid phase by integrating from a reference Uhlenbeck-Ford model potential.

- The simulations used by this method are all fixed volume and therefore will not relax the system to a given pressure. Instead, it is expected that the given system is already relaxed to the target pressure of interest.  Specifically, the final dump files generated by the relax_liquid calculation serve as ideal input configurations for this calculation.
