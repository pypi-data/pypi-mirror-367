# secheaders
Python script to check HTTP security headers


Same functionality as securityheaders.io but as Python script. Also checks some server/version headers. Written and tested using Python 3.8.

With minor modifications could be used as a library for other projects.

**NOTE**: The project renamed (2024-10-19) from **securityheaders** to **secheaders** to avoid confusion with PyPI package with similar name.

## Installation

The following assumes you have Python  installed and command `python` refers to python version >= 3.8.

### Install

```
$ pip install secheaders
```

### Building and running locally

1. Clone into repository
2. `python -m build`
3. `pip install dist/secheaders-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl`
4. Run `secheaders --help`


### Running from source without installation

1. Clone into repository
2. Run `python -m secheaders`


## Usage
```
usage: secheaders [-h] [--target-list FILE] [--max-redirects N] [--insecure] [--file FILE] [--json] [--no-color] [--verbose] [URL]

Scan HTTP security headers

positional arguments:
  URL                   Target URL (default: None)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --target-list FILE    Read multiple target URLs from a file and scan them all (default: None)
  --max-redirects N     Max redirects, set 0 to disable (default: 2)
  --insecure            Do not verify TLS certificate chain (default: False)
  --file FILE, -f FILE  Read the headers from file or stdin rather than fetching from URL (default: None)
  --json                JSON output instead of text (default: False)
  --no-color            Do not output colors in terminal (default: False)
  --verbose, -v         Verbose output (default: False)
```

## Design principles

The following design principles have been considered:

* Simplicity of the codebase.
	* The code should be easy to understand and follow without in-depth Python knowledge.
* Avoidance of external dependencies.
	* The Python Standard Libary provides enough tools and libraries for quite many use cases.
* Unix philosophy in general
	* *"Do one thing and do it well"*

These are not rules set in stone, but should be revisited when doing big design choices.
