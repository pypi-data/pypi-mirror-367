    Generate a typical set of outputs,
    notably excluding the plasma flux tables which usually require much more
    run time than the rest of the outputs combined.

    Note: during initialization, the extent of the computational grid may be
    adjusted to achieve the target spatial resolution. The adjusted extent
    will always bound the requested extent.

    Args:
        ods: An OMAS object in the format produced by device_description
        min_extent: [m] rmin, rmax, zmin, zmax extent of computational domain.
                    This will be updated during mesh initialization, during which it
                    may be adjusted to satisfy the required spatial resolution.
        dxgrid: [m] Spatial resolution of computational grid
        max_nmodes: Maximum number of structure modes to keep. Defaults to 40.
        show_prog: Whether to show terminal progress bars. Defaults to True.
        plasma_coil_force_method: Whether to interpolate B-field on the fully-realized mesh tables,
                                  or do direct filament calculations from points inside the limiter mask.
                                  Defaults to "mask", which is faster and uses less memory, but only includes
                                  nonzero entries inside the limiter, which requires a valid limiter geometry.
        n_radial_slices: Number of radial slices to use for chunking large structures. Each slice is centered
                            at the limiter centroid.
        gridspec: Exact alternative to min_extent. Only one of min_extent or gridspec should be provided.
