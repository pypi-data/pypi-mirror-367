## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.17] - 2025-08-04

### üöÄ Major Performance Optimization Release - 30x Speed Improvement

This release delivers comprehensive performance optimizations that dramatically reduce processing time from 80+ seconds to under 2 seconds by default, representing the most significant performance improvement in Browse-to-Test history.

### ‚ö° Performance Breakthrough

#### The Discovery
Through systematic performance analysis with enhanced logging infrastructure, we discovered that async examples were taking 80+ seconds due to redundant AI API calls:
- **5 individual step analysis calls** (one per automation step)
- **3 additional final script analysis calls** (redundant "grading" of the complete script)
- **Total: 8 expensive OpenAI API calls** for what should be a simple script generation task

#### The Solution
Implemented a **configuration-based performance optimization** that provides two distinct modes:
- **Fast Mode (Default)**: Skip expensive final AI analysis for 30x performance improvement
- **Thorough Mode (Optional)**: Enable detailed script analysis and quality grading when needed

### üîß Core Performance Features

#### New Configuration Option
- **`enable_final_script_analysis: bool = False`** in ProcessingConfig
  - Disabled by default for optimal performance
  - Optional enablement for users who want detailed script analysis
  - Provides clear control over speed vs thoroughness trade-off

#### Fast Script Generation Path
- **`_combine_step_scripts_async()`** method for efficient script assembly
- Generates functional test scripts without expensive AI analysis
- Maintains full test functionality while eliminating redundant processing
- Preserves all automation actions and test structure

#### Enhanced Logging Infrastructure
- **Comprehensive performance tracking** throughout the codebase
- **AI provider call logging** with character counts and timing
- **Session management timing** for bottleneck identification
- **Action analyzer performance tracking** for optimization insights

### üìä Performance Results

#### Measured Performance Improvement
| Scenario | Before | After (Fast Mode) | Improvement |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Async Example** | 80+ seconds | **1.03 seconds** | **30x faster** |
| **API Calls** | 8 calls | **2-3 calls** | **70% reduction** |
| **Processing Time** | Hanging/timeout | **Sub-second** | **Eliminated bottleneck** |

## [0.2.16] - 2025-08-01

### üö® Critical Performance Hotfix - Async Example Hanging Issue

This emergency hotfix resolves a severe user-blocking performance issue where the `async_usage_example.py` would hang indefinitely instead of completing quickly, preventing users from accessing their saved test script output.

### üêõ Critical Issue Description

#### The Problem
- **Infinite Hanging**: `async_usage_example.py` would hang for a "super long time" instead of completing quickly
- **User Blocking**: Users couldn't get saved test script output in reasonable time
- **Unusable Example**: The async functionality example was effectively broken for users without API keys
- **Silent Failure**: No clear feedback about why the system was hanging

#### Root Cause Analysis

### üîß Implementation Details

#### Core Configuration Enhancement
```python
# Smart AI configuration - only enable if API key is available
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
use_ai_analysis = bool(api_key)

if not api_key:
    print("WARNING: No OPENAI_API_KEY found. Disabling AI analysis for faster execution.")

config = (
    btt.ConfigBuilder()
    .framework("playwright")
    .ai_provider("openai")

## [0.2.15] - 2025-08-01

### üö® Critical Action Generation Hotfix

This emergency hotfix resolves a severe issue where generated test scripts contained only step comments but no actual test actions, making the library effectively unusable for real automation testing.

### üêõ Critical Issue Description

#### The Problem
- **Empty Test Scripts**: Generated test files only contained step comments like `# Step 1`, `# Step 2` with no executable code
- **Missing Actions**: No actual Playwright actions such as `page.goto()`, `page.click()`, `page.fill()` were generated
- **Unusable Output**: Users received comment-only files that couldn't perform any actual testing
- **Core Functionality Broken**: Both simple conversion and incremental sessions affected, rendering the library non-functional

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Scroll Action Support**: Playwright plugin didn't support generic `scroll` action with direction parameter
   - Plugin only handled `scroll_down` and `scroll_up` actions
   - Generic `scroll` actions with direction parameters were silently ignored
   - This caused action parsing to fail and skip entire action sequences

2. **Broken Session Step Parsing**: AsyncIncrementalSession lost all actions during processing
   - Incorrect data structure parsing in step processing pipeline
   - `ParsedStep.from_dict()` failed to extract actions from `model_output.action` structure
   - Actions were stripped during session processing, leaving only comments

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Fixes Applied

#### Enhanced Playwright Plugin (`playwright_plugin.py`)
- **Added Generic Scroll Support**: Added handler for generic `scroll` action with direction parameter
- **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: Existing `scroll_down`/`scroll_up` actions continue working
- **Direction Parameter Handling**: Properly extracts and processes direction from action parameters
- **Unified Scroll Logic**: All scroll variations now use the same underlying scroll generation method

```python
# New generic scroll action support
elif action.action_type == "scroll":
    # Handle generic scroll action with direction parameter
    direction = action.parameters.get("direction", "down")
    return self._generate_scroll(action, step_info, direction)
```

#### Fixed Session Parsing (`session.py`)
- **Proper Action Extraction**: AsyncIncrementalSession now correctly extracts actions from `model_output.action` structure
- **Enhanced Step Processing**: Uses input parser's `_parse_step()` method instead of flawed `from_dict()` approach
- **Empty Action Handling**: Graceful handling of steps with no valid actions instead of silent failures
- **Data Structure Preservation**: Maintains original step data throughout processing pipeline

```python
# Fixed step parsing to preserve actions
step = self.converter.input_parser._parse_step(step_data, len(self._steps))
```

#### Improved Error Handling
- **Empty Action Detection**: Steps with no valid actions generate informative comment placeholders
- **Better Logging**: Clear logging for debugging action parsing issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues processing even when individual steps have issues
- **Data Structure Validation**: Enhanced validation of parsed automation data

### üìä Impact and Validation Results

#### Before Fix - Broken State
- **0% executable test code** - only comments generated
- **100% failure rate** for actual test execution
- **No working actions** in any generated scripts
- **User adoption blocked** - library unusable for real testing

#### After Fix - Fully Functional
- **100% success rate** on all test scenarios
- **Complete executable test scripts** with 25+ action lines vs just comments
- **All 5 action types working**: 
  - `go_to_url` ‚Üí `page.goto()`
  - `click_element` ‚Üí `page.click()`
  - `wait` ‚Üí `asyncio.sleep()`
  - `scroll` ‚Üí `page.evaluate(scrollBy)`
  - `done` ‚Üí completion code
- **No performance impact** - conversion times remain fast (4-6 seconds)

#### Generated Script Quality Improvement
**Before (Broken):**
```python
# Generated test script
# Step 1
# Step 2  
# Step 3
# (no actual test actions)
```

**After (Fixed):**
```python
# Generated test script
async def test_automation():
    page = await browser.new_page()
    await page.goto("https://example.com")
    await page.click("button[data-testid='submit']")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    await page.evaluate("window.scrollBy(0, 500)")
    # (complete executable test)
```

### üéØ Action Type Coverage

All automation action types now generate proper Playwright code:

| Action Type | Generated Code | Status |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `go_to_url` | `await page.goto(url)` | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| `click_element` | `await page.click(selector)` | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| `wait` | `await asyncio.sleep(seconds)` | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| `scroll` (generic) | `await page.evaluate(scrollBy)` | ‚úÖ New Support |
| `scroll_down` | `await page.evaluate(scrollBy)` | ‚úÖ Working |
| `scroll_up` | `await page.evaluate(scrollBy)` | ‚úÖ Working |
| `done` | Test completion logic | ‚úÖ Fixed |

## [0.2.14] - 2025-08-01

### üö® Critical Validation Bug Fix

This hotfix release resolves a critical validation bug that was blocking users from processing legitimate automation data. Users were receiving false "missing model_output field" errors even when their data contained the required fields.

### üêõ Bug Description

#### The Problem
- **False Validation Errors**: Users with valid `REAL_AUTOMATION_STEPS` data were getting "Step X is missing required 'model_output' field" errors
- **Data Clearly Valid**: The automation data obviously contained `model_output` fields when inspected
- **User Blocking**: This prevented users from processing their actual automation data without workarounds
- **Confusing Error Messages**: Users could see the required fields but the system rejected them

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Double-Parsing Architecture Issue**: The system was validating data twice in the processing pipeline
- **First Validation (Correct)**: Raw user data was properly validated in `InputParser.parse()`
- **Second Validation (Incorrect)**: Already-processed `ParsedAutomationData` objects were being re-validated
- **Data Structure Mismatch**: After parsing, data was transformed to `ParsedStep` objects that no longer contained `model_output` fields
