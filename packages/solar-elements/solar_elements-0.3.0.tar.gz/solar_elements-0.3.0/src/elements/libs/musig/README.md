# MuSig2 - Multi-Signatures

MuSig2 is an upcoming standard for creating and verifying multisigs,
which are signatures that have been composed from more than one person
signing at the same time.

This is useful when you need multiple people to collectively sign off
on an important event, like fund allocation.

This library also includes a basic implementation of schnorr signing,
which is the standard used by nostr for event signatures.
