# Elements

Elements is a Python library for interacting with Solar, a framework for building
cross-compatible social media platforms. Solar is built around the nostr protocol
as a standard for storing and sharing verifiable data.

## Development Information

Elements is in active development. Current version: v0.2.2

This package is maintained using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/#configuring-credentials)

This library has too many external dependencies. It should be able to work with the basic
urllib instead of using "requests", but fixing this is not my priority at the moment.
