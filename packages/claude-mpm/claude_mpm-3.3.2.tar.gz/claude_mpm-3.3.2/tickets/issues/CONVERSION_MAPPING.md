| Original Task | New Issue | Title | Type | Severity |
|--------------|-----------|-------|------|----------|
| TSK-0010 | ISS-0001 | Refactor high-complexity functions | enhancement | high |
| TSK-0011 | ISS-0002 | Split god classes using Single Responsibility Principle | enhancement | high |
| TSK-0012 | ISS-0003 | Increase test coverage to 80% | enhancement | critical |

## Conversion Notes

All items were converted from tasks to issues because they represent:
- **Problems to solve** rather than implementation steps
- **What needs to be fixed/improved** rather than how to fix it
- **Enhancements** to the codebase quality and architecture

The epic EP-0001 should be updated to reference these new issue IDs instead of the old task IDs.
