# Technical Debt: Tree-Sitter Codebase Analysis Findings

## Description
Comprehensive tree-sitter analysis revealed technical improvement opportunities. Test coverage: 23.6%, Code complexity hotspots: 40 functions >10, God classes: 7 classes >20 methods, Module coupling issues in orchestrators.

## Technical Analysis Reports

The following analysis reports provide detailed findings and recommendations:

- **[Basic Analysis Report](../../docs/codebase-analysis/codebase_analysis_report.md)** - Initial tree-sitter based analysis covering basic code metrics, module structure, and initial findings
- **[Enhanced Analysis Report](../../docs/codebase-analysis/codebase_analysis_enhanced_report.md)** - Deep dive into complexity hotspots, god classes, test coverage gaps, and detailed improvement recommendations
- **[Executive Summary](../../docs/codebase-analysis/tree_sitter_analysis_summary.md)** - High-level summary of findings, key metrics, and prioritized action items for leadership review
- **[Codebase Visualizations](../../docs/codebase-analysis/codebase_visualizations.md)** - Visual representations of code structure, complexity heatmaps, and dependency graphs

## Issues

The following issues describe the problems and improvements needed for this epic:

- [ ] **ISS-0001**: Refactor high-complexity functions (enhancement, severity: high)
- [ ] **ISS-0002**: Split god classes using Single Responsibility Principle (enhancement, severity: high)
- [ ] **ISS-0003**: Increase test coverage to 80% (enhancement, severity: critical)
- [ ] **ISS-0004**: Reduce module coupling in orchestrators (enhancement, severity: medium)
- [ ] **ISS-0005**: Eliminate code duplication (enhancement, severity: high)
- [ ] **ISS-0006**: Optimize async operations performance (enhancement, severity: low)

## Notes

### Conversion Note (2025-07-24)
The above items were converted from tasks (TSK-0010 through TSK-0015) to issues (ISS-0001 through ISS-0006) to properly reflect that they describe **problems to solve** and **what needs to be improved** rather than implementation steps. Issues are more appropriate for describing enhancements and problems that need resolution, while tasks are reserved for single-agent implementation steps.

_Add any additional notes or context here._
