A powerful orchestration framework for Claude Code that enables multi-agent workflows, session management, and real-time monitoring through an intuitive interface.

> **Quick Start**: See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) to get running in 5 minutes!

## Features

- ü§ñ **Multi-Agent System**: Automatically delegates tasks to specialized agents (PM, Research, Engineer, QA, Documentation, Security, Ops, Data Engineer)
- üîÑ **Session Management**: Resume previous sessions with `--resume` 
- üìä **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live dashboard with `--monitor` flag
- üìÅ **Multi-Project Support**: Per-session working directories
- üîç **Git Integration**: View diffs and track changes across projects
- üéØ **Smart Task Orchestration**: PM agent intelligently routes work to specialists

## Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install claude-mpm

# Or with monitoring support
pip install "claude-mpm[monitor]"
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended)
claude-mpm

# Non-interactive with task
claude-mpm run -i "analyze this codebase" --non-interactive

# With monitoring dashboard
claude-mpm run --monitor

# Resume last session
claude-mpm run --resume
```

For detailed usage, see [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)

## Key Capabilities

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
The PM agent automatically delegates work to specialized agents:
- **Research**: Codebase analysis and investigation
- **Engineer**: Implementation and coding
- **QA**: Testing and validation
- **Documentation**: Docs and guides
- **Security**: Security analysis
- **Ops**: Deployment and infrastructure

### Session Management
- All work is tracked in persistent sessions
- Resume any session with `--resume`
- Switch between projects with per-session directories
- View session history and activity

### Real-Time Monitoring
The `--monitor` flag opens a web dashboard showing:
- Live agent activity and delegations
- File operations with git diff viewer
- Tool usage and results
- Session management UI

See [docs/monitoring.md](docs/monitoring.md) for full monitoring guide.
