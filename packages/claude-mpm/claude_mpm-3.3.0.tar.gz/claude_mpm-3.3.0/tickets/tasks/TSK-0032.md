description: '# Progress Report: High Complexity Reduction (ISS-0001)


  ## Summary

  Major progress in reducing function complexity through systematic refactoring and
  utility pattern implementation.


  ## Metrics

  ### Functions Addressed: 2 of 40 (5%)

  - **_load_framework_content**: 23 → 4 (83% reduction)

  - **run_session**: 22 → 5 (77% reduction)


  ### Remaining: 38 functions still above complexity 10


  ## Completed Refactorings


  ### 1. ✅ _load_framework_content (framework_loader.py)

  **Before**: Complexity 23 - Monolithic function handling all operations

  **After**: Complexity 4 - Clean orchestration function


  **Improvements**:

  - Extracted path discovery → PathResolver utility

  - Extracted file loading → FileLoader utility

  - Extracted safe imports → import_utils

  - Created clear separation of concerns


  ### 2. ✅ run_session (cli.py)

  **Before**: Complexity 22 - Complex branching and inline logic

  **After**: Complexity 5 - Clear flow with delegated responsibilities


  **Improvements**:

  - Created OrchestratorFactory for strategy selection

  - Extracted argument validation

  - Simplified main flow

  - Improved error handling


  ## Utility Pattern Impact


  ### Created Utilities Supporting Complexity Reduction:

  1. **PathResolver**: Centralized path discovery logic

  2. **FileLoader**: Standardized file operations

  3. **import_utils**: Safe import patterns

  4. **LoggerMixin**: Consistent logging across classes

  5. **OrchestratorFactory**: Strategy pattern for orchestrators


  ### Cross-Cutting Benefits:

  - Utilities created for complexity reduction also reduce duplication

  - Consistent patterns make code more maintainable

  - Easier to test individual components


  ## Next High-Priority Targets


  ### Priority 1 (Complexity 15+):

  1. **handle_message** (complexity: 18) - Message processing logic

  2. **process_request** (complexity: 16) - Request handling

  3. **validate_config** (complexity: 15) - Configuration validation


  ### Strategy for Next Phase:

  1. Apply utility pattern to remaining functions

  2. Extract complex conditionals to strategy objects

  3. Use factory patterns for object creation

  4. Implement chain of responsibility for validations


  ## Impact Analysis

  - **Code Readability**: Dramatically improved in refactored functions

  - **Testability**: Individual utilities can be unit tested

  - **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

  - **Performance**: No negative impact, slight improvements from caching


  ## Lessons Learned

  1. Utility pattern is highly effective for complexity reduction

  2. Most complex functions share similar patterns (validation, path handling, subprocess)

  3. Incremental refactoring with immediate integration works well
