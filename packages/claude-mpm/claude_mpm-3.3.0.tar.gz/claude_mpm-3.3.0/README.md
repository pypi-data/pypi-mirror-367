# Claude MPM - Multi-Agent Project Manager

> **Note**: This project is a fork of [claude-multiagent-pm](https://github.com/kfsone/claude-multiagent-pm), enhanced to integrate with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) v1.0.60+'s native agent system. This integration enables seamless orchestration of Claude Code's built-in agents (research, engineer, qa, documentation, security, ops, version_control, data_engineer) through a unified project management interface.

> **⚠️ Version 2.0.0 Breaking Changes**: Agent schema has been standardized. Agent IDs no longer use the `_agent` suffix (e.g., `research_agent` → `research`). See the [migration guide](docs/user/05-migration/schema-standardization-migration.md) for details.

A framework for Claude that enables multi-agent workflows and extensible capabilities through a modular architecture.

## Quick Start

### Why Interactive Mode?
**Interactive mode is significantly more performant** than non-interactive commands. It maintains context between requests and avoids the overhead of repeatedly launching Claude, making your development workflow much faster and more efficient.

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally via npm (recommended)
npm install -g @bobmatnyc/claude-mpm

# Or install via PyPI
pip install claude-mpm

# Or use npx for one-time usage
npx @bobmatnyc/claude-mpm
```

### Three Essential Use Cases

#### 1. 🔍 **Understand Your Codebase**
Start with codebase exploration - perfect for onboarding or getting oriented:

```bash
# Launch interactive mode
claude-mpm

# Then ask:
> Explain the codebase structure. What are the main components, how do they interact, and what architectural patterns are used?
```

#### 2. 🚀 **Build a New Project** 
For greenfield development, use detailed, AI-generated prompts for best results:

```bash
claude-mpm

# Example detailed prompt (AI-generated prompts work best):
> Create a modern web application with the following requirements:
> - Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
> - Authentication using NextAuth.js with GitHub provider
> - PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
> - User dashboard with CRUD operations for "projects"
> - API routes following REST conventions
> - Responsive design with dark/light mode toggle
> - Form validation using react-hook-form and zod
> - Include proper error handling and loading states
> - Set up ESLint, Prettier, and basic testing with Jest
> - Generate a complete project structure with all necessary files
```

#### 3. 🔧 **Enhance Existing Code**
For working on your current codebase, provide rich context:

```bash
claude-mpm

# Example detailed enhancement prompt:
> I need to add real-time notifications to my existing Next.js application. Current tech stack:
> - Next.js 13 with app router
> - TypeScript
> - Tailwind CSS
> - PostgreSQL with Prisma
> - User authentication already implemented
> 
> Requirements:
> - WebSocket-based real-time notifications
> - Toast notifications in the UI
> - Database table to store notification history
> - Mark as read/unread functionality
> - Different notification types (info, warning, success, error)
> - Admin panel to send system-wide notifications
> - Email fallback for offline users
> 
> Please analyze my current codebase structure and implement this feature following my existing patterns and conventions.
```

### 💡 Pro Tips for Better Results

1. **Use AI to generate your prompts**: Ask ChatGPT or Claude to help you create detailed, specific prompts for your use case
2. **Provide context**: Include your tech stack, requirements, and any constraints
3. **Stay interactive**: Keep the conversation going to refine and iterate on solutions
4. **Ask for explanations**: Request explanations of architectural decisions and trade-offs

### Alternative: Non-Interactive Mode
For automation or simple one-off tasks:

```bash
# Quick analysis
claude-mpm run -i "What testing frameworks are used in this project?" --non-interactive

# With subprocess orchestration for complex tasks
claude-mpm run --subprocess -i "Audit this codebase for security vulnerabilities" --non-interactive
```

**Note**: Non-interactive mode has higher overhead and is less efficient for multi-step development workflows.
