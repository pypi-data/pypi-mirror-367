# Geo-Calcite Python Client

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/geo-calcite.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/geo-calcite) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A lightweight Python client for interacting with the Geo-Calcite API.  
Provides helpers for connecting to, refreshing, querying, and disconnecting from Geo-Calcite data sources over HTTP, and returns results as native Python objects or pandas DataFrames.

---

## Features

- **Connect** to one or more Geo-Calcite data sources by DID (data identifier)  
- **Refresh** existing connections  
- **Disconnect** from data sources  
- **Query** connected sources via SQL and return results as a pandas DataFrame

```python
# Import and create a GeoCalcite client, ignore if already created.
from geo_calcite import GeoCalciteClient
client = GeoCalciteClient()

# Connect to datasource, like "pbdb" with its DID "1"
dids = [1]
client.connect(dids)

# SQL query for data entity, remove "LIMIT 5" to get full data. 
sql = "SELECT * FROM pbdb.gx_8260001_pbdb LIMIT 5"
df = client.query(sql)
print(df)

# Disconnect from datasource after use.
client.disconnect(dids)
```
