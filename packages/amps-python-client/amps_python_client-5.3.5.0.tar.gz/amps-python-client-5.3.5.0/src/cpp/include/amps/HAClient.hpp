/// \file HAClient.hpp
/// \brief Defines AMPS::HAClient, a client that can provide failover, durable
/// publication, and resumable subscriptions.
///


namespace AMPS
{
/// A highly-available Client that automatically reconnects and
/// re-subscribes to AMPS instances upon disconnect.
///
/// An HAClient provides failover and resubscription functionality by default.
/// For reliable publish, set a PublishStore for the HAClient (and, in most
/// cases, set a FailedWriteHandler as well so the application can detect
/// any failed publishes). For managing transaction log replays, set a
/// bookmark store (such as LoggedBookmarkStore or MemoryBookmarkStore).
///
/// To connect to AMPS, you must provide a ServerChooser implementation to
/// the HAClient. By default, the HAClient provides an ExponentialDelayStrategy
/// with the default delay and backoff behavior for that class.
///
/// By default, the HAClient object has the reconnect and resubscribe
/// functionality provided by the MemorySubscriptionManager and a default
/// DisconnectHandler. It is typically not necessary to replace the
/// disconnect handler or subscription manager for this class. Notice that
/// replacing either of these defaults will change the failover, resubscription,
/// and/or republish behavior of the HAClient.
///
/// See the <em>Developer Guide</em> for more information on using the HAClient.
