static const char* memorypublishstore_class_doc = R"docstring(MemoryPublishStore()
A publish store that keeps messages in memory. This class is the
default publish store for a Python HAClient. The HAClient manages
storing messages in the publish store, replaying messages to the
server after failover, and removing messages from the store. With
this publish store, an application typically checks to be sure
that the publish store is empty (that is, all messages have been
persisted in the AMPS server) before exiting.
