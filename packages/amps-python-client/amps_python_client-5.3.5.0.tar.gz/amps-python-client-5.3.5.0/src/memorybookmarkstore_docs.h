static const char* memorybookmarkstore_class_doc = R"docstring(MemoryBookmarkStore(adapter)
A bookmark store that maintains information about the recovery
point for bookmark subscriptions in memory.

When the bookmark store is set on a Client or HAClient,
the AMPS client library manages adding subscriptions to the
store and tracking bookmarks as they arrive. The AMPS HAClient
uses the bookmark store on failover to recover bookmark subscriptions
at the appropriate point.

For a bookmark subscription, an application must discard messages
when they have been processed. The other methods on this class
are not typically called by the application during normal use.

A ``RecoveryPointAdapter`` may optionally be specified when created
to add something such as storage in a SOW using :class:`SOWRecoveryPointAdapter`
to prevent any message loss if the client application dies.

:param adapter: A ``RecoveryPointAdapter`` object that provides
                additional storage capabilities, such as 
                :class:`SOWRecoveryPointAdapter`.
                Default is None. *Optional*.
