# NOTE: Actively tested on Python 3.9 - 3.13 and may plausibly break on greater
# versions due to C extension hacks.  However, setting a maximum version causes
# new Python versions to simply install very old versions of Functiontrace that
# didn't have the `requires-python` annotation on them and are also unlikely to
# work.  Best to only set the minimum and let bug reports notify us of issues
# with new Python releases.
