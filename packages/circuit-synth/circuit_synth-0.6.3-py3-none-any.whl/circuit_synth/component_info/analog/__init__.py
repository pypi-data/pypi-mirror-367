Analog IC integrations.

This module will provide integrations for analog ICs including:
- Operational amplifiers
- Comparators
- ADCs and DACs
- Analog switches and multiplexers
- Reference voltage sources

Future implementations will include intelligent component selection
and configuration assistance for analog circuit design.
