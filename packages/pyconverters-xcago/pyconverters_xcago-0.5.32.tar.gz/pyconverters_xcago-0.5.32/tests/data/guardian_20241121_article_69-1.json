I am a biologist by background and did my PhD research in rainforest ecology in Borneo, before I went into photography and ilm-making. I saw so much destruction in the rainforest back in the 90s, and it dawned on me that I could publish scientiic articles that maybe 10 people would read \u2013 or an article in National Geographic that 10 million people would see . \r\nThis fruiting ig tree was unique , in that it didn\u2019t have any branches connecting it to other trees, so the orangutan had to climb right up the roots growing on the trunk to reach the canopy. I had been thinking about getting a picture like this for years: a wide shot looking down on an orangutan in its habitat. I was on the ground when one irst passed me and I thought: \u201cOK, it\u2019s going to come back tomorrow \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of fruit there.\u201d I went and got my gear, climbed the tree and rigged up three camera mounts with diferent viewpoints . \r\nWhile it was still dark the next morning, I put the cameras up and, over the next three days, another two orangutans visited. I had a remote control on the ground so when the orangutan was climbing, I triggered the camera. Had I been up the tree myself, I would never have got the shot. I do a lot of bird photography, often from hides: you efectively have to make yourself invisible to get a shot. But that doesn\u2019t work with orangutans. I\u2019ve built hides up in the canopy where I\u2019m totally camoulaged and birds , gibbons and monkeys all come , not noticing me. But an orangutan always knows you\u2019re there. \r\nThey are not aggressive toward people, generally. I\u2019m drawn to them because they\u2019re one of the great apes \u2013 our closest relatives \u2013 but they are much harder to photograph and study than, say, chimpanzees or gorillas, because they spend very little time on the ground and don\u2019t live in social groups. \r\nThis image won me the Wildlife Photographer of the Year award in 2016. I think its success is due to the perspective. Most of the orangutan pictures I\u2019ve taken have been with a long lens from down on the ground, or from a hill with an eye -level view. So being able to get a wide shot looking down \u2013 that\u2019s probably what captured the judges\u2019 interest. There are so many great wildlife photographs out there : to win , you need to shoot something in a unique way .\r\nI do all kinds of nature photography but if I had to pick one thing, birds are my biggest passion. You have to be patient, keep trying new things and put in the time \u2013 waiting for the animals to show up, for good light, all that stuf. There are deinitely frustrating moments: like trying to photograph a bird of paradise, sitting in a hide for a week, and they never come back. Or you don\u2019t get any good behaviour to capture. Or it rains. There can be times when you spend a week, get nothing and have to give up. But it beats sitting in an oice in front of a computer all day. Interview by Amy Fleming.
