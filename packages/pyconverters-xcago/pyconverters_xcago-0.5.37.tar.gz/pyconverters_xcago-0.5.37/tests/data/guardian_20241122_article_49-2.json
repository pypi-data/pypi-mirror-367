Richard was correctly identiied in the smaller image, where she was pictured with her husband, Edward Petherbridge. We apologise for this error (Journal, p10) . \u2022\u00a0The former chief executive of Hong Kong is Carrie Lam, not \u201cLim\u201d as an editorial said (20 November, Journal, p2). Editorial complaints and corrections can be sent to guardian.readers@theguardian.com \n\nIMAGES\n\nBODY\n  Challenges of improving policing across Britain \r\nYet again we have a senior chief constable calling for a single national police force ( In England and Wales, where you live determines the kind of policing you get. That isn\u2019t right, theguardian.com, 18 November). Gavin Stephens rightly points out the logistical diiculties created by having 43 separate and independent police forces in England and Wales, but he fails to mention the other side of the coin: the increased danger in reduced accountability and the potential increases in the abuse of power by concentrating the considerable powers of chief constables into a single authority.\r\nThe importance of pluralism in police provision is occasionally seen in the identiication of poor performance and the rectiication of abuses by chief constables. To do this would be far more diicult in a single national force. My time on the West Yorkshire police authority when it was an integral part of the West Yorkshire metropolitan county council was salutary. Its policing of the 1984-85 miners\u2019 strike was signiicantly diferent from the more confrontational actions in South Yorkshire. It is not possible to guarantee which policy would be followed by a single national force. I would not wish the latter style to become nationally dominant.\r\n\u2022 I agree that policing is a postcode lottery : 43 diferent models and a lawed funding strategy drives repetition, poor eiciency and public confusion. As the then Dorset police and crime commissioner (PCC), I attempted to merge Dorset and Devon & Cornwall police several years ago , potentially saving hundreds of millions of pounds. The merger had ministerial and Home Oice approval, yet failed at the last hurdle. The problem is that 43 chief constables and 43 PCC s will resist it. A royal commission into policing is the only way to break the deadlock and improve service to the public.\r\nMartyn Underhill Former police and crime commissioner, Wimborne, Dorset \r\n\u2022 On the face of it, there\u2019s a lot to agree with in Gavin Stephens\u2019 article. Of course, policing \u201cmust work to regain the trust and conidence of our communities, give a voice to those who have not been well served by policing and learn from the very best global practice\u201d. But I\u2019d suggest that the \u201cexcellent use of facial recognition technology\u201d is not universally welcome. Many of us regard it as an unwarranted intrusion on our lives that has been introduced by police services without debate and without suitable safeguards in place. Earning trust and conidence involves policing by informed consent, not the imposition of technology by stealth.\r\nAlan Jewitt Melksham, Wiltshire \r\n\u2022 Gavin Stephens is arguing the case for change that has been around for decades. There are about 170,000 police oicers in the UK, not far removed from the armed forces or NHS Scotland. These organisations have numerous strategic and operational head oices, but nowhere near 43. As he points out, many crimes are similar in investigation. Reorganisation into a single, central strategic headquarters with ive or six regional operations centres is about 30 years overdue. Forty-three chief constables have a strong vested interest to stop Mr Stephens. I wish him luck to do the right thing for the citizens they serve. \r\nKevin O\u2019Rourke Glenbrook , New South Wales, Australia \r\nWhen social care is put in private hands \r\nAs someone who has worked in children\u2019s homes since the 1960s and who is part of a community of people who have experience of generally good children\u2019s homes, I don\u2019t expect the government\u2019s proposed reforms will have the desired efect (Overhaul of children\u2019s social care will crack down on proiteering, 18 November) .When care was put in the hands of proit-driven providers and local authorities and charities stopped providing the homes that some ran well in the past, what did we think would happen? \r\nWhen social workers are so restricted in time and resources that they are forced to turn to shameless proiteers to accommodate children who need a home, love and childcare expertise, why are we shocked that children are not getting the support they need? \r\nAnd what makes us think that \u201cquality\u201d can be injected into children\u2019s homes by requiring them to comply with ill-conceived rules and regulations? Regulation that is more to do with the protection of policy and decision-makers than with the love, care and wellbeing provided by a good children\u2019s home. Cost itself is not the issue. The security and community that good children\u2019s homes created remain, even if the buildings are gone. They understand their purpose and stick to it. Over time, they cost our society comparatively little and beneit us all. \r\nJohn Burton Tiverton, Devon \r\n\u2022 Heather Stewart writes that improving working conditions at the coalface of social care is more important than the drive to cap consumers\u2019 costs (It\u2019s time to talk about paying vital staf fairly, 18 November) . But the funding crisis is so desperate that the irst question asked of those who need it is whether they have the money to pay for it. If they do have savings, then however severe their need for medical care \u2013 which should be paid for by the NHS \u2013 they will invariably end up paying all the fees for their care home place, at a cost of thousands of pounds a month. \r\nWhen their savings run out, the council then pays. The culture of collusion between councils and the NHS that has grown out of chronic underfunding has tainted assessments of people\u2019s needs. It\u2019s time for this to be dragged from under the carpet. \r\nJanet Maitland London \r\nAbetter way to gauge the nation\u2019s wellbeing \r\nThe use of alternative metrics to GDP has a long history within the environmental movement (ONS seeks to measure \u2018inclusive income\u2019 as an alternative to GDP, 19 November). \r\nGDP was never meant to be a measure of national or even of economic wellbeing. It simply measures sales, and is always the same igure as national expenditure. The person who invented the measure \u2013 Simon Kuznets \u2013 called it national income, which it also mirrors. \r\nThe idea that if we spend more we are better of is obviously silly. Economic activity has a qualitative as well as a quantitative aspect. A good analogy is with food: if we have none we will starve, but it does not follow from that that we should eat as much as we can. After staving of hunger, what matters is what we eat, not how much. \r\nThe question to ask is not how much economic activity we can generate but rather what we want the economic activity to do, and how that can be achieved. The idea that \u201cgrowth\u201d will solve all our problems is misguided.\r\n Dr Jon Mulberg The Open University \r\nBus fare rise is just the ticket for public \r\nAs a non-driver and bus user all my life, I can understand why the government has raised the bus fare cap to \u00a33. Anyone who has used buses for a long time knows that this is still cheaper than it\u2019s been for years in most areas. I suspect most people asked about the rise (Editorial, 21 November) were not bus users or had bus passes. \r\nTrevor Hopper Lewes , East Sussex \r\n\u2022 Anyone who thinks raising the bus fare cap to \u00a33 is OK either never travels by bus or holds in contempt the demographic that needs to use them. \r\nLois Ozlojo Southend-on-Sea \r\n\u2022 Re the Covid letters (Covid isn\u2019t funny \u2013 it still harms too many, 16 November) , it\u2019s OK to joke about dark stuf . Laughter is a defence mechanism. My fellow medical students and I relied on dark humour to get us through the awful things we saw as youngsters in the 1970s. Humour is a coping strategy and we all emerged as competent, caring doctors . \r\nDr Roger Timms Norwich \r\n\u2022 Re calling tourists in Cornwall emmets or grockles (Letters, 20 November) \u2013 both are ofensive. They are holidaymakers hoping to enjoy our beautiful county. I\u2019d like to think that when I leave Cornwall to visit other places I will welcomed, not called a name. \r\nMaggie Matthews Helston, Cornwall \r\n\u2022\u00a0I inquired about a basic health check when I reached my mid-70s and was told that unless I was on medication, it was not available (Letters, 20 November). Rather counterproductive.\r\nLynda McDonald Edinburgh \r\n",
