The cause of death was determined to be strangulation and asphyxiation and she had also been raped. \r\nAvon and Somerset police have been reinvestigating the killing and yesterday arrested the man from the Ipswich area of Sufolk on suspicion of murder and rape. \r\nThe man, who would have been in his mid -30s when Dunne died, has been taken into custody for questioning. \r\nPolice have identiied and spoken to members of Dunne\u2019s family and are running extra patrols in Easton to reassure the public . \r\nThe force said the arrest was made after \u201ca signiicant development in the investigation\u201d, which resulted from a review of the case launched last year. The review included further forensic examinations of items relating to the case. \r\nDunne had been married twice, to a Bristol local politician and a night watchman, but both had died before her. Her body was discovered by a neighbour who spotted that a window was slightly open, which was very unusual for her. \r\nHer friend, Alice Clarke, who had spent time with Dunne just before her murder, told the Bristol Evening Post at the time: \u201c When she left she said, as she always did: \u2018Good night. God bless. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be seeing thee.\u2019 \u201d \r\nOver the years police have launched multiple appeals to try to catch her killer. \r\nD I Dave Marchant said: \u201cThis is an extremely signiicant moment in an appalling and distressing case, which has remained unsolved for almost six decades. \r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identiied and spoken to Louisa Dunne\u2019s next of kin to update them on this development, and specialist family liaison officers will now be supporting them \u2013 to keep them updated on the progress of our investigation but also to ensure they get access to any specialist support they may need. \r\n\u201cAn arrest was made earlier today by officers from Avon and Somerset police and there will be operational police activity in the Ipswich area as a result. We\u2019d like to thank our colleagues in Sufolk police for their ongoing help and support. \r\n\u201cWe recognise this will also come as a shock to the community in Easton. While this tragic incident happened a long time ago, there will be people who remember what happened and may have had a connection with Louisa through family or friends. \r\n\u201cThe neighbourhood policing team will be carrying out extra patrols of the area, so please speak to an officer if you have any worries or concerns. \r\n\u201cAs this investigation is at a critical phase and to protect the integrity of any future criminal proceedings, we won\u2019t be able to conirm the full details, but we are absolutely committed to continue carrying out a thorough investigation to try and bring Louisa\u2019s relatives the answers they\u2019ve waited a lifetime for.\u201d \r\n",
