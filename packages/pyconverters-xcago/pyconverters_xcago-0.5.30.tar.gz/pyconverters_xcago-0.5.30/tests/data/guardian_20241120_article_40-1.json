People used to bring [my] temperament up: \u2018Oh yeah, but his temperament.\u2019 I was like: \u2018Really?\u2019 You\u2019ll see me even calmer and kinder when it goes wrong. Trust me, you get nowhere being that way. \r\n\u201cI\u2019m not naive enough to know those moments aren\u2019t coming. I don\u2019t know when, but it\u2019s going to happen. I feel like some [people] are waiting for it to happen. I know that and I have to stay calm .\u201d \r\nThe bonus is that this comeback victory means Wales can look towards making a head start in their bid to qualify for another World Cup. Harry Wilson, who has now scored four goals in his past ive matches for his country, capped an impressive win over Iceland, who led inside seven minutes courtesy of Andri Gudjohnsen. \r\nLiam Cullen scored twice before Brennan Johnson got on the scoresheet, inishing in style, and Wilson thrashed in from distance. \r\nThe last time these sides met in Cardif a No 11 by the name of Gareth Bale scored a goal for the ages, zooming of the pitch momentarily, and here the heir to that shirt number, Johnson, ofered Wales breathing space on another ine night for Bellamy.\r\nThe Wales manager has three wins and three draws and, more signiicantly, this result ensured his team topped Group B4, with Montenegro\u2019s victory at home to Turkey paving the way for Wales to achieve promotion to Group A. \r\nWales squandered a two-goal lead in Reykjavik in the reverse ixture last month so Wales were well versed on Iceland\u2019s talents. Bellamy talked up an exciting side spearheaded by Orri \u00d3skarsson, the 20-year-old who joined Real Sociedad from Copenhagen for \u20ac20m in August, and coached by a veteran manager in Norwegian \u00c5ge Hareide.\r\nIt did not stop Bellamy from appearing personally insulted by the manner of Iceland\u2019s early opener, even if in the buildup to this game the Wales manager insisted such growing pains will ultimately help his team prosper. \r\nDanny Ward made a superb save to keep out \u00d3skarsson\u2019s header from J\u00f3hann Berg Gudmundsson\u2019s devilish left-foot cross but an alert Gudjohnsen was irst to the rebound and ired a shot through Ward\u2019s legs. \r\nWales, usually fast starters, were of to a sleepy beginning. Cullen had the hosts\u2019 irst real efort on 23 minutes, a tame shot after Johnson cut in from the right lank. Ten minutes later Johnson located Cullen, this time with the intended result. \r\nJohnson collected a pass from Neco Williams and sent a brilliant left-foot cross into the box. Cullen moved towards the penalty spot, eluding his marker, Alfons Sampsted, and squeezed a glanced header inside the far post. \r\nBellamy, who again rotated, making four changes from the team that drew in Turkey last weekend, was moonlighting as a ball boy in an attempt to keep things moving and on the verge of the interval Cullen registered another important inishing touch. \r\nDaniel James saw a shot half-saved by the Brentford goalkeeper H\u00e1kon Valdimarsson and Swansea striker Cullen nipped in to feast on the leftovers. Wales survived a couple of scares before Joe Allen entered in place of forward Mark Harris, with Bellamy mindful of how things were poised. \r\nThen Wales hit the jackpot, Johnson driving into the box before applying a clean right-foot inish into the bottom corner. Wilson cracked in another ine efort, lashing in a left-foot shot from the edge of the Iceland box, to conirm Wales are in rude health before qualifying begins. \u201cWe want to go to a World Cup,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get that ticked of. If we get there, we want to compete.\u201d \r\n",
