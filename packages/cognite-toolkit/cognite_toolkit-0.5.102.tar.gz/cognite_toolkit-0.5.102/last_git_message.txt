[CDF-25390] üêõWorkflow Version retries = null causes redeployment  (#1814)

# Description

Toolkit deploys CDF resources from YAML using the `cdf deploy` command.
In this process, we do a retrieve and compare to the CDF resources, and
only do an update if the resource has changed. This PR fixes an issue
were a workflow version that has not changed is considered changed by
Toolkit.

### Fixed

- Setting `retries=null` in a `WorkflowVersion` resource, no longer
cause Toolkit to redeploy it when the workflow version is unchanged.
