[CDF-25393] ðŸ˜… GraphQL parser error (#1816)

# Description

The GraphQL parser fails for directives that looks like this

```graphql
view(
    rawFilter: {
      hasData: [
        {
          type: "container"
          space: "onse_logfile"
          externalId: "LogFile"
        }
      ]
    }   version: "1"
  )
```
due to the `version: "1"` is expected to be on a new line.

## Changelog

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## cdf

### Fixed

- [alpha] When deploying a GraphQL model, the Cognite Toolkit no longer
fails for `.graphql` schema that uses directives with multiple
components without line separation.

## templates

No changes.
