# Dockerz - Parallel Docker Build Tool

Dockerz is a powerful CLI tool that automates building multiple Docker images in parallel for services located in a project directory, including those in nested subdirectories. It streamlines the development workflow by eliminating the need for manual, sequential builds, which is especially useful during namespace migrations or branch deployments.

The tool is highly configurable, supporting custom image names, global and service-specific tags, and defaults to using the short Git commit ID as a tag if none is specified.

## Installation

You can install Dockerz directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install dockerz
```

## Quick Start

1. Install the package:

   ```bash
   pip install dockerz
   ```

2. Initialize a new project:

   ```bash
   dockerz init
   ```

   This will create a sample `services.yaml` configuration file in your current directory.

3. Edit the `services.yaml` file to configure your services

4. Build your Docker images:
   ```bash
   dockerz build
   ```

## Running Dockerz

After installation, you can run Dockerz in one of these ways:

```bash
# If Python Scripts directory is in your PATH:
dockerz [commands]

# Alternative method (always works):
py -m dockerz [commands]
```

Available commands:

- `init`: Create a new project with sample configuration
- `build`: Build Docker images based on services.yaml configuration

For help on any command:

```bash
dockerz [command] --help
```

> **Important Note**: Dockerz must be run from the root directory of the project where you intend to build Docker images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following tools are installed and configured on your system.

| Requirement                     | Purpose                                                            | Verification        |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Python 3.8+**                 | Required to execute the build script.                              | `python3 --version` |
| **Docker**                      | Required for building Docker images.                               | `docker --version`  |
| **Git**                         | Required for default version tagging.                              | `git --version`     |
| **PyYAML**                      | Python library for parsing the `services.yaml` file.               | `pip show pyyaml`   |
| **Google Cloud SDK** (Optional) | Required only if pushing images to Google Artifact Registry (GAR). | `gcloud --version`  |

### System Requirements

| Component      | Recommendation                                                    |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OS**         | Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL2 recommended).                      |
| **CPU**        | A multi-core CPU is recommended for parallel builds.              |
| **Memory**     | At least 4GB of RAM. 8GB+ is recommended for 10 or more services. |
| **Disk Space** | Sufficient disk space to store Docker images and build caches.    |

## Usage

1.  **Configure Services**: Create a `services.yaml` file in your project's root directory using the `init` command:

    ```bash
    dockerz init
    ```

    Then edit the generated file according to your needs. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for detailed instructions.

2.  **Build Images**: Run the build command from your project's root directory:

    ```bash
    dockerz build
    ```

    You can also specify the maximum number of parallel processes using the `--max-processes` flag:

    ```bash
    dockerz build --max-processes 4
    ```

    > **Note**: If the Python Scripts directory is not in your PATH, you can also use:
    >
    > ```bash
    > py -m dockerz build
    > ```

## Configuration

Dockerz is configured through a `services.yaml` file located in your project's root directory. You can create a sample configuration file using:

```bash
dockerz init
```

### Example `services.yaml`

```yaml
# Base directory to scan for Dockerfiles (relative to project root)
services_dir: ./services

# Google Cloud Configuration
project_id: my-gcp-project
gar_name: my-artifact-registry
region: us-central1

# Build Configuration
global_tag: v1.0.0 # Optional: A global tag applied to all services
max_processes: 4 # Optional: Max parallel builds (defaults to half of CPU cores)
use_gar: true # Optional: Use Google Artifact Registry naming (default: true)
push_to_gar: true # Optional: Push to GAR after building (default: same as use_gar)

# Optional: Explicitly list services to build
services:
  - name: services/service-a
    image_name: service-a-image # Optional: Custom image name
    tag: v1.0.1 # Optional: Service-specific tag
  - name: services/service-b
  - name: subdir/service-c
```

### Environment Variables

You can also override the `use_gar` and `push_to_gar` settings using environment variables:

| Variable      | Description                                                                               |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_GAR`     | Set to `true` or `false` to override the `use_gar` setting in the configuration file.     |
| `PUSH_TO_GAR` | Set to `true` or `false` to override the `push_to_gar` setting in the configuration file. |

## Features

- **Parallel Builds**: Concurrently builds Docker images to save time, with a configurable limit to prevent system overload.
- **Flexible Directory Structure**: Supports services in nested subdirectories.
- **Configurable**: Uses a `services.yaml` file to manage service directories, GAR details, and tags.
- **Flexible Tagging**: Supports a global tag, service-specific tags, or defaults to the short Git commit ID.
- **Error Handling**: Logs build successes and failures to a file and the console without interrupting other builds.
- **Image Naming**: Constructs image names in the format `{region}-docker.pkg.dev/{project_id}/{gar_name}/{service_name}:{tag}`.

## Google Artifact Registry (GAR) Integration

The script is designed to integrate seamlessly with Google Artifact Registry.

1.  **Enable GAR Integration**: In `services.yaml`, set `use_gar` to `true` to use GAR naming conventions and `push_to_gar` to `true` to automatically push images after a successful build.

2.  **Authentication**: Ensure you are authenticated with GAR by running:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth configure-docker {region}-docker.pkg.dev
    ```

When GAR integration is enabled, the script will:

- Name images using the format: `{region}-docker.pkg.dev/{project_id}/{gar_name}/{service_name}:{tag}`.
- Also supports custom image names if specified in `services.yaml`.
- Automatically push images to GAR if `push_to_gar` is `true`.
- Log failed pushes separately in the build summary.
- Store detailed build and push logs in the `logs` directory.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                         | Solution                                                                                                        |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Script Not Found**          | Use the absolute path to the script (e.g., `python3 /path/to/docker.py`).                                       |
| **`services.yaml` Not Found** | Ensure the `services.yaml` file is in your project's root directory, not the script's directory.                |
| **Wrong Working Directory**   | Always run the script from the root of the project where you want to build Docker images.                       |
| **Path Errors**               | Verify that the relative paths in `services.yaml` are correct and that the script is run from the project root. |
| **System Overload**           | Reduce the `max_processes` value in `services.yaml` or via the `--max-processes` flag.                          |
| **Docker Permission Errors**  | On Linux, run `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` and then log out and back in.                                     |
| **Missing `Dockerfile`**      | Ensure that each service directory contains a valid `Dockerfile`.                                               |
| **`PyYAML` Not Found**        | Install the required library by running `pip install pyyaml`.                                                   |
| **Git Errors**                | Make sure the project is a Git repository. If not, run `git init`.                                              |
| **GAR Authentication**        | Authenticate with GAR by running `gcloud auth configure-docker {region}-docker.pkg.dev`.                        |
