Welcome to Kard-X, a pure command-line interface (CLI) card game where strategy meets simplicity. Built with Python and designed for extensibility, Kard-X offers a classic deck-builder experience with a modern, tech-inspired feel.

## Features

-   **Purely Text-Based:** Enjoy a clean, distraction-free, and retro-cool gaming experience in your terminal.
-   **Data-Driven Design:** All cards and characters are defined in simple `.jsonc` files. Modifying the game or creating new content is as easy as editing a text file!
-   **Strategic Depth:** Manage your Health (HP), Defense (DEF), and Mana to outwit your opponent. Grow stronger by permanently increasing your Max Mana.
-   **Infinite Replayability:** A robust card-cycling system ensures the battle never ends. Choose from different hero archetypes and face unique enemies.

## Installation

You can install Kard-X directly from PyPI with a single command:

```bash
pip install kard-x
```

*Requires Python 3.10 or higher.*

## How to Play

After installation, simply type the following command in your terminal to start the game:

```bash
kardx
```

### Troubleshooting: Command Not Found?

If you run `kardx` and get an error like "command not found", it's likely that your Python Scripts directory isn't in your system's PATH.

Don't worry! You can use this universal command instead, which works on all systems:

```bash
python -m kardx
```
This method directly asks your Python interpreter to find and run the `kardx` module, bypassing any PATH issues.

## Game Concept

The game starts with a Character Selection screen. Each character begins with a unique starting deck.

-   **Objective:** Reduce the enemy's HP to zero.
-   **Turns:** Each turn, you draw 5 cards and your Mana is refilled. Play cards by spending Mana.
-   **Card Effects:**
    -   **Attack:** Deal damage to the enemy.
    -   **Defense:** Gain DEF to block incoming damage for one turn.
    -   **Power:** Play cards like `Mana Crystal` to permanently increase your Max Mana, enabling more powerful combos in later turns.
-   **Deck Cycling:** When your draw pile is empty, your discard pile is automatically shuffled back into it, allowing you to use your cards indefinitely.

## Roadmap (Future Development)

Kard-X is built to be expanded. Here's what's planned for the future:

-   [ ] **Card Reward System:** Gain new cards after winning a battle.
-   [ ] **More Enemies & Bosses:** Introduce enemies with unique AI and abilities.
-   [ ] **Relics & Artifacts:** Add passive items that grant special bonuses.
-   [ ] **Event System:** Encounter non-combat events that offer choices and consequences.
-   [ ] **Color Support:** Using libraries like `colorama` or `rich` to enhance the UI.
