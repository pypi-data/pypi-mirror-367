## Overview

**xdep** is an integrated pipeline designed to simplify the development and evaluation of trustworthy computer vision models.  
It provides an end-to-end framework for training, interpreting, and visualizing deep learning models with a focus on transparency and reliability.

---

## Features

- Easy setup and modular pipeline to build trustworthy computer vision models  
- Integrated support for popular explainability techniques (e.g., LIME)  
- Automated generation of evaluation reports and visualizations (CSV, figures)  
- Lightweight and easy to extend for custom workflows  
- Command-line interface (CLI) for quick experimentation and testing

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version from [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/xdep/) (for testing) or [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/xdep/) (for production):

```bash
pip install xdep
```

---

## Dependencies

`xdep` requires the following Python packages (automatically installed with `pip`):

* `lime >= 0.2.0.1`
* `matplotlib`
* `pillow`
* `rich`
* `scikit-learn`
* `seaborn`
* `tensorflow`

---

## Quick Start

### Using as a Python Package

Hereâ€™s a minimal example of how to use `xdep` in your Python code:

```python
from xdep import main

# Call the main pipeline function or your preferred API
main.main()
```

---

### Using the CLI

After installation, you can run the `xdep` command directly in your terminal:

```bash
xdep
```

This will show available commands and options.

---

## Directory & Output Handling

`xdep` saves generated CSV files and figures to a `results` directory in the current working directory by default.

* If the `results` directory does not exist, it will be created automatically.
* You can configure output directories and filenames via the API or CLI arguments.
