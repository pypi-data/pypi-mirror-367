# CYCLE DETECTION SAFETY DEMONSTRATION
#
# This ensemble demonstrates the cycle detection safety feature that prevents
# infinite loops in misconfigured fallback chains.
#
# USAGE:
#   llm-orc invoke cycle-detection-demo "Test cycle detection"
#
# CYCLE DEMONSTRATED:
#   cycle-test-a → cycle-test-b → cycle-test-c → cycle-test-a (CYCLE!)
#
# EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
# - The system detects the cycle before it causes an infinite loop
# - A clear error message is displayed: "Cycle detected in fallback chain"
# - The agent falls back to the system default (legacy fallback)
# - The ensemble continues to work despite the configuration error
#
# SAFETY BENEFIT:
# - Prevents infinite recursion that could crash the system
# - Provides clear diagnostic information for debugging
# - Gracefully handles misconfigured fallback chains
# - Maintains system stability even with configuration errors

agents:
  - name: "cycle-test-agent"
    model_profile: "cycle-test-a"
    system_prompt: "This agent will trigger cycle detection in the fallback chain."

default_task: "This task will trigger a cycle detection error, demonstrating the safety mechanism."
