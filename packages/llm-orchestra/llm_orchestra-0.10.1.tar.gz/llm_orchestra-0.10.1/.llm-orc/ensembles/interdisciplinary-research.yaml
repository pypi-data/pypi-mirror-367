      2. Unexpected connections or patterns identified across disciplines
      3. Ethical considerations and societal implications
      4. Potential future scenarios based on current trends
      5. Novel research questions or hypotheses that arise from this analysis
      6. Practical implications for policy or decision-making
      
      Focus on insights that wouldn't be apparent from any single disciplinary perspective.
