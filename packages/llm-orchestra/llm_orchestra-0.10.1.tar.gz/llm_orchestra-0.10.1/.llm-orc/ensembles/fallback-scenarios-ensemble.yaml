description: "Comprehensive demonstration of configurable fallback scenarios"

# COMPREHENSIVE FALLBACK SCENARIOS DEMONSTRATION
#
# This ensemble tests multiple fallback scenarios in a single run to show
# the robustness and flexibility of the configurable fallback system.
#
# USAGE:
#   llm-orc invoke fallback-scenarios-ensemble "Explain system resilience patterns"
#
# SCENARIOS DEMONSTRATED:
#
# 1. CASCADE-DEMO AGENT:
#    - Uses premium-claude profile with full cascading chain
#    - Chain: premium-claude → standard-claude → micro-claude → local-llama
#    - Shows how expensive models gracefully degrade to cheaper alternatives
#
# 2. DIRECT-FALLBACK-DEMO AGENT:  
#    - Uses guaranteed-fail profile (nonexistent model/provider)
#    - Direct fallback: guaranteed-fail → local-llama
#    - Shows single-hop fallback to reliable local model
#
# 3. WORKING-BASELINE AGENT:
#    - Uses local-llama profile (should always work)
#    - Provides reliable baseline comparison
#    - Shows normal operation without fallbacks
#
# WHAT TO OBSERVE:
# - Different agents may end up using different actual models
# - Clear messaging about which profiles failed and which fallbacks were used
# - All agents should eventually produce responses despite failures
# - Performance comparison between fallback vs baseline agents
