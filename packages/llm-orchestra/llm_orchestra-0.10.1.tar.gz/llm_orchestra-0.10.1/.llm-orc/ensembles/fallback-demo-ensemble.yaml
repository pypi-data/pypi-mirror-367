# CONFIGURABLE FALLBACK SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION
# 
# This ensemble showcases the new configurable fallback system (Issue #56).
# 
# USAGE:
#   llm-orc invoke fallback-demo-ensemble "Analyze renewable energy trends"
#
# WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
# - If premium-claude fails ‚Üí automatically tries standard-claude
# - If standard-claude fails ‚Üí automatically tries micro-claude  
# - If micro-claude fails ‚Üí automatically tries local-llama
# - Clear display showing which model profile failed and which fallback is used
#
# FALLBACK CHAIN DEMONSTRATED:
#   premium-claude ‚Üí standard-claude ‚Üí micro-claude ‚Üí local-llama ‚Üí system default
#
# EXPECTED OUTPUT EXAMPLES:
#   ‚ö†Ô∏è Model profile 'premium-claude' failed for agent 'premium-analyzer': No OAuth token found
#   üîÑ Using fallback model 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' for agent 'premium-analyzer'...
#
# BENEFITS:
# - Cost optimization: Gracefully fall back from expensive to cheaper models
# - Reliability: Continue working even when premium services are unavailable
# - Transparency: See exactly which model is being used and why
