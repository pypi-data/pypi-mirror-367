description: Test ensemble with multi-level dependencies (A,B,C → D → E,F → G)

agents:
  # Level 1: Independent agents (A, B, C)
  - name: agent-a
    model_profile: quality
    system_prompt: You are agent A. Provide analysis from perspective A.

  - name: agent-b
    model_profile: quality
    system_prompt: You are agent B. Provide analysis from perspective B.

  - name: agent-c
    model_profile: quality
    system_prompt: You are agent C. Provide analysis from perspective C.

  # Level 2: Agent D depends on A, B, C
  - name: agent-d
    model_profile: quality
    depends_on: [agent-a, agent-b, agent-c]
    system_prompt: You are agent D. Synthesize the input from agents A, B, and C.

  # Level 3: Agents E, F depend on D
  - name: agent-e
    model_profile: quality
    depends_on: [agent-d]
    system_prompt: You are agent E. Build on agent D's synthesis from your perspective.

  - name: agent-f
    model_profile: quality
    depends_on: [agent-d]
    system_prompt: You are agent F. Build on agent D's synthesis from your perspective.

  # Level 4: Agent G depends on E, F
  - name: agent-g
    model_profile: quality
    depends_on: [agent-e, agent-f]
    system_prompt: You are agent G. Provide final synthesis from agents E and F.
