FROM lunamidori5/pixelarch:quartz

## We are using Pixelarch here as it is built to be easyer to test / run real world programs as if you where on a prod arch server / desktop
## It has a full copy of bash installed (themed and setup with compleations), it also uses the ``yay`` package manager
## Giving users the power to use the AUR or the normal Arch repos

RUN sudo sed -i 's/Quartz/Elroy/g' /etc/os-release

## Using the sed command lets us tell the OS that it is now not quartz flavored. 
## This lets the os know what type of flavor its running for programs that check

## Quartz is the flavor as it only has ``yay`` installed and nothing else, so its only about 400mbs total
## ``yay`` uses the same command layout as pacman, making it easyer to install programs
