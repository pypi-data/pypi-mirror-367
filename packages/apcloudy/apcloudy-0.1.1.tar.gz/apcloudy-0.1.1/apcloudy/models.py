"""
This module defines classes and functionalities to handle scraping jobs,
spiders, and projects. It includes data representations for job execution
states, jobs, spiders, and projects.

The module provides detailed representations and helper methods to create
instances of these classes from dictionaries, typically corresponding to API
responses. It also includes properties and static methods to parse and format
relevant data.

Classes:
  - JobState: Enum for job execution states.
  - Job: Represents a scraping job, its attributes, and utility methods.
  - Spider: Represents a spider and its configurations.
  - Project: Represents a project and associated metadata.

    several states a job may transition through during its lifecycle, which can

    states include when a job is scheduled, actively running, completed, or
