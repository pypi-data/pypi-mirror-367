First release of sdssviz_ca25, an visualization package for SDSS AGN created for the Code/Astro 2025 Workshop, using DR17 of the SDSS AGN Catalog (v0.0.1). This first release allows the user to:

1. Download a chosen number of AGN photometric and spectroscopic data from SDSS.
2. Visualize the AGN population along a small number of available parameters (e.g. RA&Dec)
3. Using an interactive plot, select an individual AGN to see its spectrum.

Please be aware that this package is not currently maintained and should not be used for science in its present state!. But if you are interested in developing it further, please contact the authors. Please install via pip:

$ pip install sdssviz_ca25
