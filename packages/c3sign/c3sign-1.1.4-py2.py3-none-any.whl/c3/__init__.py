# 1.1.3 Text loading correctly handles windows CRLFs.
# 1.1.2 Commandline file loading is simpler and more explicit now.
# 1.1.1 Ability for Verify commandline to specify multiple --trusted to simulate multiple certs.

# Future todos:
# - dual/multi passwords for private keys
# - Visible Fields support for PRIV_CRCWRAP_SCHEMA
# - it would be nice if the text description included whether things were CSRs etc
# - add --expiry override to sign for Renew operations.
