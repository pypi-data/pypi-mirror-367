# Policy: anything with "block" in the name is bytes.
#         File, Txt, Block

# Policy: public binary structure - sticking with "chain[0].data_part can be payload or cert"
#         rather than "seperate payload & sig top level structure" because it makes verify simpler
#         & its too much change at this point.
#         (Also makes verify a lot simpler to implement in *other* languages quickly)

# Policy: verify() only reads from self.trusted_ces, it doesnt write anything into there.
#         Caller/User must call add_trusted_certs() to add theirs.

# Note: the priv key encrypt/decrypt functions are here too, just to keep things to 1 class for now.

    # Just open the files and read them and dump them into a single text variable.

    # The filenames only matter for txt-vs-binary (text is if extensions  .txt .b64 or .*)
