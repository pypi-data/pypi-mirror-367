# Why LLM Evaluation?

Large Language Models are unpredictable - they produce different outputs every time, even with identical inputs. Without systematic evaluation, you're flying blind.

## What Goes Wrong Without Evaluation

- **Manual testing doesn't scale** - Testing a few examples tells you nothing about real performance
- **Production surprises** - Models fail on edge cases you never tested
- **No way to compare models** - "Claude seems better" isn't a data-driven decision
- **Resource waste** - Using expensive models when cheaper ones would work
- **No improvement path** - Can't measure if changes actually help

## What Evaluation Gives You

**Systematic measurement** - Test your model on 1000s of examples, get precise accuracy scores

**Data-driven decisions** - Compare models objectively: "Claude: 94% accuracy, GPT-4: 89%, $2.3x cheaper"

**Early problem detection** - Find edge cases during development, not in production

**Continuous improvement** - Track performance over time and measure impact of changes

## Real-World Examples

**Customer Support Bot** - Without evaluation: Launch, discover 40% failure rate. With evaluation: Test on support dataset, find 94% accuracy, identify API question gaps, fix before launch.

**Content Generation** - Without evaluation: Inconsistent quality, no prediction. With evaluation: 78% meet standards, identified technical topic weakness, improved prompts.

**Code Generation** - Without evaluation: Developers report broken code. With evaluation: 67% correctness, 89% valid syntax, focus improvement on logic not syntax.

## When You Need Evaluation

**Essential for:**
- Building LLM-powered features for production
- Comparing models or providers (cost vs quality decisions)
- Improving prompts or measuring fine-tuning impact
- Production monitoring and regulatory compliance

**Optional for:**
- One-off scripts or personal experiments
- Outputs that get full human review anyway

## The Key Insight

LLM evaluation is like unit testing for AI. Unlike traditional software (deterministic), LLMs are probabilistic, subjective, and context-dependent - requiring statistical analysis across many examples to draw reliable conclusions.

## Getting Started

1. **[Install doteval](installation.md)** - Get up and running in minutes
2. **[Try your first evaluation](tutorials/01-your-first-evaluation.md)** - Start with a simple example
3. **[Learn the concepts](explanation/design-principles.md)** - Understanding evaluation principles

**Bottom line:** LLM evaluation isn't optional for production systems - it's as essential as testing is for traditional software.
