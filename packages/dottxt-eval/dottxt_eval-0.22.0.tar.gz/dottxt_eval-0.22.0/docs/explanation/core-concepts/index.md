# Core Concepts

Understanding the fundamental building blocks that power doteval's evaluation framework.

## Core Components

- **[The @foreach Decorator](foreach-decorator.md)** - Deep dive into doteval's central abstraction
- **[Result Models and Scoring](result-models-scoring.md)** - How evaluation outcomes are structured and measured
- **[Session Management](session-management.md)** - Experiment lifecycle and storage philosophy

## Architecture Patterns

- **[Registry Architecture](registry-architecture.md)** - How doteval enables extensibility and discovery

Each concept builds on the others to create a coherent evaluation framework that scales from simple one-off evaluations to complex, multi-model production pipelines.
