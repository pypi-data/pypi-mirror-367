Hello! Glad you stumbled onto this wrapper. This is by far my biggest undertaking yet, and it only gets bigger.

### Quick Disclaimer

Some of the following text is taken from the ArtifactsMMO Website to ensure it is accurate and well put for beginner developers or new players to be able to understand. It is adapted to match the information available within this wrapper though

## How to begin playing ArtifactsMMO

Artifacts is an asynchronous MMORPG in which you can control up to 5 characters at the same time. Your characters can fight monsters, gather resources, craft items and much more.

This wrapper however is thus far a synchronous wrapper, so you have to use the threading module to control more than one character at once

Unlike a traditional game, you'll have to write your own scripts in your preferred programming language to control your characters via an API.

This wrapper is an easy way to get started with playing ArtifactsMMO Season 3. It allows you to access the API without writing too much complex code.

For another quick start, you can write your own Javascript scripts directly in the client's code editor, otherwise you can use any language you like on your own IDE. You can see examples in other programming languages in the [Reference API](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/).

## Before You Begin

The first step is to [create your account](https://artifactsmmo.com/account/create) and your first character [by logging in](https://artifactsmmo.com/account/characters). After that you'll need your token, which you can find [on your account](https://artifactsmmo.com/account/).
**⚠️ It is not allowed to play with more than one account. All accounts involved in multi-accounting will be banned**

![API Token Box](https://artifactsmmo.com/images/docs/token.png)

**⚠️ The token is used by the server to identify you when you make requests. It is important to keep it secret.**

You can now open the game client by [clicking here](https://artifactsmmo.com/client).

**The built in editor supports Node.JS only. It is recommended to use VS Code or Pycharm with this wrapper**
