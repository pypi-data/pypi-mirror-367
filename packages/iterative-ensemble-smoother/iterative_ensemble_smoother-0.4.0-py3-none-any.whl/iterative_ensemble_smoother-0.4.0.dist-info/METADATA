## About

**iterative_ensemble_smoother** is a Python package that implements the subspace iterative ensemble smoother as described in [evensen2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fams.2019.00047/full).
This algorithm is particularly effective for problems with a large number of parameters (e.g., millions) and a few realizations or samples (e.g., hundreds).

## Installation

**iterative_ensemble_smoother** is on PyPi and can be installed using pip:

```text
pip install iterative_ensemble_smoother
```

If you want to do development, then run:

```text
git clone https://github.com/equinor/iterative_ensemble_smoother.git
cd iterative_ensemble_smoother
<create environment>
pip install --editable '.[doc,dev]'
```

## Usage

**iterative_ensemble_smoother** mainly implements the two classes `SIES` and `ESMDA`.
Check out the examples section to see how to use them.

## Building the documentation

```bash
apt install pandoc # Pandoc is required to build the documentation.
pip install .[doc]
sphinx-build -c docs/source/ -b html docs/source/ docs/build/html/
```

## Releasing a new version

- Create a tag, e.g. `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "A short note" cf2c87270d3` locally on the commit.
- Push the tag, e.g. `git push upstream v1.0.0`.
- Create a release on the GitHub GUI.
