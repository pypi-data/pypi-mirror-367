    """Registered Callback.

    This class wraps around an async function and allows passing it into
    the API.

    The signature of the function should be:

    ```python
        async def callback(
            interface_id: int,
            method_index: int,
            input: DynamicStruct,
            fulfiller: Fulfiller) -> None:
            ...
    ```

    The `input` contains the parameter the method was called with.
    The `fulfiller` is used to fulfill or reject the request. Note that
    the function must not return anything, but use the `fulfiller` to
    return the result. The reason for that is to allow the capnp thread
    to easily await the result, without having to deal with the async
    function directly.
    It the function returns or raises an exception, before the result is
    Fulfilled, that capnp request will hang forever. This should always
    be avoided.
