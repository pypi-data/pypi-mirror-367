**ADB-based automation for Android emulators like LDPlayer**

`adbauto` is a Python library that simplifies automation for Android games and apps running in emulators. It provides tools to connect to an emulator, capture screenshots, match UI elements visually, and simulate input like taps and scrolls.

## 🚀 Features

- Connect to LDPlayer or other Android emulators via ADB  
- Capture screenshots directly from the device  
- Locate UI elements via OpenCV template matching  
- Simulate taps and scrolling actions  
- Designed for building automation scripts for games
