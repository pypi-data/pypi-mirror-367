"""slurmster.core (legacy)

This module has been **refactored** into smaller, focused sub-modules for
maintainability:

- env_setup.py    configuration loading + remote environment preparation
- submission.py   job script generation & sbatch submission
- monitor.py      live log streaming for a single run
- run_status.py   status table helpers
- fetch.py        retrieve finished run directories
- cancel.py       cancel running jobs
- remote_utils.py  shared helper utilities (path resolution, wait helpers, â€¦)

The public API remains unchanged.  All former symbols are re-exported from the
new implementation modules so existing imports keep working unchanged.
