    """
    Fast Fourier Transform node for frequency domain analysis.

    The FFT node performs windowed Fast Fourier Transform on input data
    to convert time-domain signals to frequency-domain representations.
    It supports overlapping windows, various window functions, and proper
    amplitude scaling for spectral analysis.

    This node is essential for BCI applications that analyze frequency
    content of neural signals, such as detecting alpha rhythms, motor
    imagery patterns, or steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP).

    Features:
        - Configurable window size and overlap
        - Multiple window functions (Hanning, Hamming, Blackman, etc.)
        - Proper amplitude scaling and normalization
        - Rolling buffer for continuous processing
        - Decimation for overlapping windows
        - FFT optimization for real-valued signals

    Args:
        window_size (int): Size of the FFT window in samples. Must be > 1.
        window_function (str): Window function name (default: 'boxcar').
            Supports all scipy.signal window functions.
        overlap (float): Overlap ratio between windows (0.0 to 1.0).
            Default is 0.5 (50% overlap).

    Note:
        Input data must have frame_size=1 for proper windowing.
        Output frame rate is reduced by the step size (decimation).
