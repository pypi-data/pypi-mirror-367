    INode combines the functionality of ioiocore.INode and Node to provide a
    base class for nodes that only have input ports (no outputs). These are
    typically sink nodes that consume data without producing output, such as
    file writers, displays, or data loggers.

    All INode subclasses must implement the step() method to define their
    specific data consumption behavior. The setup() method validates input
    port contexts and ensures required metadata is present.

    Attributes:
        Input ports are managed by the parent ioiocore.INode class.
        Node-specific configuration is handled by the parent Node class.
