class Highpass(Butterworth):
    """Highpass filter implementation using Butterworth design.

    This class provides a convenient interface for creating highpass filters
    by extending the Butterworth filter implementation. It automatically
    configures the filter for highpass operation with a specified cutoff
    frequency.

    Highpass filters allow frequencies above the cutoff frequency to pass
    through while attenuating frequencies below the cutoff. This is commonly
    used in BCI applications to remove low-frequency drift, DC offset, or
    slow artifacts while preserving higher-frequency neural activity.

    The filter uses Butterworth design characteristics, providing maximally
    flat response in the passband with no ripples, making it suitable for
    applications requiring smooth frequency response above the cutoff.

            The cutoff frequency is defined as the -3dB point where the
            filter response is 0.707 (-3dB) of the passband gain. Higher
            order filters will have steeper transitions around this point.
