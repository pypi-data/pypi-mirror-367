class Lowpass(Butterworth):
    """Lowpass filter implementation using Butterworth design.

    This class provides a convenient interface for creating lowpass filters
    by extending the Butterworth filter implementation. It automatically
    configures the filter for lowpass operation with a specified cutoff
    frequency.

    Lowpass filters allow frequencies below the cutoff frequency to pass
    through while attenuating frequencies above the cutoff. This is commonly
    used in BCI applications for anti-aliasing, noise reduction, or isolating
    slow cortical potentials and low-frequency brain rhythms.

    The filter uses Butterworth design characteristics, providing maximally
    flat response in the passband with no ripples, making it suitable for
    applications requiring smooth frequency response.

            f_c: Cutoff frequency in Hz. Frequencies below this value will
                pass through with minimal attenuation, while frequencies
                above will be attenuated according to the filter order.
            order: Filter order. Higher orders provide steeper rolloff
                but may introduce more phase distortion. Defaults to
                DEFAULT_ORDER from parent class.
            **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to parent Butterworth class.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If f_c is not positive.

        Note:
            The -3dB point (half-power frequency) occurs at the cutoff
            frequency f_c. The actual attenuation at f_c depends on the filter
            order, with higher orders providing steeper rolloff
            characteristics.
