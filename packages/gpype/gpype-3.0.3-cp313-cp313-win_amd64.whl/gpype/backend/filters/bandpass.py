class Bandpass(Butterworth):
    """Bandpass filter implementation using Butterworth design.

    This class provides a convenient interface for creating bandpass filters
    by extending the Butterworth filter implementation. It automatically
    configures the filter for bandpass operation with specified lower and
    upper cutoff frequencies.

    Bandpass filters allow frequencies within a specific range to pass through
    while attenuating frequencies outside this range. This is commonly used
    in BCI applications to isolate specific frequency bands of interest
    (e.g., alpha, beta, or gamma rhythms).

    The filter uses Butterworth design characteristics, providing maximally
    flat response in the passband with no ripples, making it suitable for
    applications requiring smooth frequency response.

            order: Filter order. Higher orders provide steeper rolloff
                but may introduce more phase distortion. Defaults to

            this range will pass through with minimal attenuation, while
            frequencies outside will be attenuated according to the filter
            order and Butterworth characteristics.
