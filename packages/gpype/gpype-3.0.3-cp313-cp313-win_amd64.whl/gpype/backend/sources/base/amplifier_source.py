class AmplifierSource(Source):
    """Base class for amplifier-based data acquisition sources.

    This abstract class provides the foundation for interfacing with hardware
    amplifiers and data acquisition devices in BCI applications. It extends
    the basic Source functionality with amplifier-specific configuration
    and device management capabilities.

    The class handles:
    - Hardware device enumeration and management
    - Sampling rate configuration with inheritance support
    - Multi-channel data acquisition setup
    - Frame-based data buffering configuration

    Features:
    - Support for INHERITED sampling rate (determined at runtime)
    - Device list management for hardware abstraction
    - Automatic port configuration for amplifier data streams
    - Integration with g.Pype timing and context framework

    Attributes:
        _devices: List of available amplifier devices
        _device: Currently selected/connected amplifier device

    Note:
        This is an abstract base class. Concrete implementations must
        provide device-specific connection and data acquisition logic.
        The sampling rate can be set to Constants.INHERITED (-1) to
        indicate it should be determined during device setup.
