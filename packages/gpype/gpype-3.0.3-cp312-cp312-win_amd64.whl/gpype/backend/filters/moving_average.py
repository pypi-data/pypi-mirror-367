class MovingAverage(GenericFilter):
    """Moving average filter for signal smoothing and noise reduction.

    This class implements a moving average filter using various window
    functions. Moving average filters are linear phase FIR filters that
    smooth signals by averaging values within a sliding window.

    The filter is commonly used in BCI applications for:
    - Signal smoothing and noise reduction
    - Trend analysis and baseline correction
    - Feature extraction preprocessing

    The implementation supports various window functions including rectangular
    (boxcar), Hamming, Hanning, and others available in scipy.signal.

    Attributes:
        window_size: Length of the averaging window
        window_function: Type of window function applied

    Note:
        Moving average filters introduce delay equal to (window_size-1)/2
        samples, which should be considered in real-time applications.
