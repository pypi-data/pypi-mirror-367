    ONode combines the functionality of ioiocore.ONode and Node to provide a
    base class for nodes that only have output ports (no inputs). These are
    typically source nodes that generate data without consuming input, such as
    signal generators, file readers, or data acquisition devices.

    All ONode subclasses must implement the step() method to define their
    specific data generation behavior. The setup() method delegates to the
    parent class for output port context configuration.

    Attributes:
        Output ports are managed by the parent ioiocore.ONode class.
        Node-specific configuration is handled by the parent Node class.
