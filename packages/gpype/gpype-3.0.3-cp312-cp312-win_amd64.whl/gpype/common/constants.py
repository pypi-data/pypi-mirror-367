class Constants(ioc.Constants):
    """
    Application-wide constants for g.Pype BCI framework.

    Extends the ioiocore Constants class to provide g.Pype-specific
    constants, data types, and configuration keys used throughout
    the BCI processing pipeline.

    This class centralizes all constant values to ensure consistency
    across the framework and provides a single point of maintenance
    for shared configuration parameters.

        Configuration key constants for pipeline components.

        Defines standard key names used in configuration dictionaries
        throughout the g.Pype framework. These keys ensure consistent
