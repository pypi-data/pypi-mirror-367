The all-in-one library that provides everything you need
to query Apple's FindMy network!

The current "Find My-scene" is quite fragmented, with code
being all over the place across multiple repositories,
written by [several authors](https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py/blob/main/#Credits). This project aims to
unify this scene, providing common building blocks for any
application wishing to integrate with the Find My network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is currently in Alpha. While existing functionality
> will likely not change much, the API design is subject to change
> without prior warning.

> You are encouraged to report any issues you can find on the

## Contributing

Want to contribute code? That's great! For new features, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py/issues) first so we can discuss.

This project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting.
Before opening a pull request, please ensure that your code adheres to these rules.
There are pre-commit hooks included to help you with this, which you can set up as follows:

```shell
pip install uv
uv sync  # this installs ruff & pre-commit into your environment
pre-commit install
```

After following the above steps, your code will be linted and formatted automatically
before committing it.

While I designed the library, the vast majority of actual functionality
is made possible by the following wonderful people and organizations:

- @seemo-lab for [OpenHaystack](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/)
  and their [research](https://doi.org/10.2478/popets-2021-0045);
- @JJTech0130 for [Pypush](https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush), providing the breakthrough necessary
  for getting this to work without a Mac;
- @biemster for [FindMy](https://github.com/biemster/FindMy), which is the main basis of this project;
- @Dadoum for [pyprovision](https://github.com/Dadoum/pyprovision/) and
