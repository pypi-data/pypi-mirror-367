## Installation ⚙️

1. Install the package via pip:

   ```bash
   pip install django-sightline
   ```


2. Add `'sightline'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'sightline',
       ...
   ]
   ```


3. Run migrations to set up the necessary database tables:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate sightline
   ```


4. Include the middlewares you need in your `MIDDLEWARE` settings:

   ```python
   MIDDLEWARE = [
       ...
       'sightline.middleware.VisitLogMiddleware',
       ...
   ]
   ```


5. Optionally, configure the `SIGHTLINE_SETTINGS` dicts to customize your tracking experience:

   ```python
   SIGHTLINE_SETTINGS = {
        "visit": {
            "enabled": True,
            "exclude_path": r"^/admin/",
            "interval_capturing": 5 # Seconds
        },
        "geoip": {
            "enabled": False,
            "marker_interval": 10 # days
        }
   }
   ```

## Usage 📝

Once installed, django-sightline automatically tracks page visits and referrers. You can view the analytics data in the Django admin interface under the "Sightline" section.

To customize the behavior, you can extend the provided models and middleware. For example, to track additional data or modify the tracking logic, customize your Admin Model with `BaseLogAdmin` and override the methods and criteria for metrics generation.
