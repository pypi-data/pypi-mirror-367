            matrix : ndarray
                Decision matrix / alternatives data.
                Alternatives are in rows and Criteria are in columns.

                Vector of criteria weights in a crisp form

            types : ndarray
                Types of criteria, 1 profit, -1 cost

            normalization: callable
                Function used to normalize the decision matrix
