Gordion's design was inspired by the west tool (https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/west),
a multi-repository management system for the Zephyr RTOS project.

While west provides a solid foundation for managing multiple repositories, Gordion was created
to address several architectural limitations:

1. Deterministic version control: Gordion forces you to specify commits,
   ensuring reproducible builds.

2. Diamond dependency resolution: When multiple repositories depend on a common repository
   (the "diamond problem"), Gordion ensures all versions are consistent by design.

   Example - Repository A depends on B and C, which both depend on D:
     A
    / \
   B   C
    \ /
     D

3. Enhanced operational workflow: Gordion provides a more intuitive command structure
   and workspace management system tailored for complex multi-repository projects.

We thank the west project maintainers and contributors for their pioneering work in
this problem space.
