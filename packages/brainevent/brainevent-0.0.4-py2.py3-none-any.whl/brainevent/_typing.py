"""
This module defines several type aliases using the `typing` module.

Type Aliases:
    MatrixShape: A tuple representing the shape of a matrix, with two integers.
    Data: A union type that can be a `jax.Array`, `numpy.ndarray`, or `brainunit.Quantity`.
    Index: A union type that can be either a `jax.Array` or `numpy.ndarray`.
    Row: Alias for Index, representing a row index.
    Col: Alias for Index, representing a column index.
    Indptr: Alias for Index, representing an index pointer.
    Kernel: A callable type, representing a function or method.
