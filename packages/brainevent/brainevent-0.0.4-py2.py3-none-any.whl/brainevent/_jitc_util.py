class JITCMatrix(u.sparse.SparseMatrix):
    """
    Just-in-time Connectivity (JITC) matrix.

    A base class for just-in-time connectivity matrices that inherits from
    the SparseMatrix class in the ``brainunit`` library. This class serves as
    an abstraction for sparse matrices that are generated or computed on demand
    rather than stored in full.

    JITC matrices are particularly useful in neural network simulations where
    connectivity patterns might be large but follow specific patterns that
    can be efficiently computed rather than explicitly stored in memory.

    Attributes:
        Inherits all attributes from ``brainunit.sparse.SparseMatrix``

    Note:
        This is a base class and should be subclassed for specific
        implementations of JITC matrices.

    This function ensures a consistent format for random seeds used in JAX operations.
    If no seed is provided, it generates a random integer between 0 and 10^8 at compile time,
    ensuring reproducibility within compiled functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seed : int or array-like, optional
        The random seed to use. If None, a random seed is generated.

    Returns
    -------
    jax.Array
        A JAX array containing the seed value(s) with int32 dtype, ensuring it's
        in a format compatible with JAX random operations.

    Notes
    -----
    The function uses `jax.ensure_compile_time_eval()` to guarantee that random
    seed generation happens during compilation rather than during execution when
    no seed is provided, which helps maintain consistency across multiple calls
    to a JIT-compiled function.
    """

def _initialize_conn_length(conn_prob: float):
    """
    Convert connection probability to connection length parameter for sparse matrix generation.

    This function transforms a connection probability (proportion of non-zero entries)
    into a connection length parameter used by the sparse sampling algorithms.
    The connection length is approximately the inverse of the connection probability,
    scaled by a factor of 2 to ensure adequate sparsity in the generated matrices.

    The function ensures the calculation happens at compile time when used in JIT-compiled
    functions by using JAX's compile_time_eval context.

    Parameters
    ----------
    conn_prob : float
        The connection probability (between 0 and 1) representing the fraction
        of non-zero entries in the randomly generated matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    jax.Array
        A JAX array containing the connection length value as an int32,
        which is approximately 2/conn_prob.

    Notes
    -----
    The connection length parameter is used in the kernels to determine the
    average distance between sampled connections when generating sparse matrices.
    Larger values result in sparser matrices (fewer connections).
