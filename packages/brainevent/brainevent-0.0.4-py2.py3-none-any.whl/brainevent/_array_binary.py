        Perform matrix multiplication on the array with another object.

        This special method implements the matrix multiplication operator (@)
        for EventArray instances. It handles matrix multiplication with different
        array types and dimensions, performing appropriate validation checks.

        Parameters
        ----------
        oc : array_like
            The right operand of the matrix multiplication. This object will be
            multiplied with the current EventArray instance.

        Returns
        -------
        ndarray or EventArray
            The result of the matrix multiplication between this EventArray instance
            and the other object.

        Raises
        ------
        MathError
            If the dimensions of the operands are incompatible for matrix multiplication
            or if the array dimensions are not suitable (only 1D and 2D arrays are supported).

        Notes
        -----
        - For 1D array @ 2D array: This performs vector-matrix multiplication
        - For 2D array @ 2D array: This performs standard matrix multiplication
        - The method checks dimensions for compatibility before performing the operation
        - If the right operand is not a recognized array type, it delegates to the
          operand's __rmatmul__ method
