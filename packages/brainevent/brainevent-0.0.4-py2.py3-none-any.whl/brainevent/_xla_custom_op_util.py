def defjvp(primitive, *jvp_rules):
    """
    Define JVP rules for any JAX primitive.

    This function allows defining Jacobian-vector product (JVP) rules for JAX primitives,
    extending the functionality of ``jax.interpreters.ad.defjvp``. While the standard
    JAX function primarily supports primitives that return a single result
    (``multiple_results=False``), this implementation supports defining independent
    JVP rules for each input parameter regardless of whether the primitive returns
    single or multiple results.

    This is particularly useful for custom operations or primitives where different
    inputs might have different differentiation rules or where the primitive naturally
    produces multiple outputs that need distinct handling in automatic differentiation.

    For concrete usage examples, refer to the test file ``test_ad_support.py``.

    Args:
        primitive: The JAX ``Primitive`` object or an ``XLACustomKernel`` instance
            for which the JVP rule is being defined. If an ``XLACustomKernel`` is
            provided, its underlying ``Primitive`` is extracted.
        *jvp_rules: A variable number of functions, each representing the JVP rule
            corresponding to a primal input argument of the primitive. Each rule
            function should accept the tangent vector for its corresponding primal input,
            followed by all the primal inputs, and any keyword arguments passed to the
            primitive. It should return the tangent vector(s) corresponding to the
            primitive's output(s). If a rule is ``None``, it implies the JVP for that
            input is zero.

    Implements a general batching rule for JAX primitive operations.
