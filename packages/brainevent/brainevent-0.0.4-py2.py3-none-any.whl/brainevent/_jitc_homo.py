    """
    Base class for Just-In-Time Connectivity Homogeneous matrices.

    This abstract class serves as the foundation for sparse matrix representations
    that use homogeneous weights with stochastic connectivity patterns. It stores
    a single weight value applied to all non-zero elements, along with connectivity
    probability and a random seed that determines the sparse structure.

    Designed for efficient representation of neural connectivity matrices where all
    connections have the same strength (weight) but are sparsely distributed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    weight : Union[jax.Array, u.Quantity]
        The homogeneous weight value applied to all non-zero elements in the matrix.
        Can be a plain JAX array or a quantity with units.
    prob : Union[float, jax.Array]
        Connection probability determining the sparsity of the matrix.
        Values range from 0 (no connections) to 1 (fully connected).
    seed : Union[int, jax.Array]
        Random seed controlling the specific pattern of connections.
        Using the same seed produces identical connectivity patterns.
    shape : MatrixShape
        Tuple specifying the dimensions of the matrix as (rows, columns).
    corder : bool
        Flag indicating the memory layout order of the matrix.
        False (default) for Fortran-order (column-major), True for C-order (row-major).

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : Tuple[WeightScalar, Prob, Seed]
            A tuple containing three elements:
            - weight: Homogeneous weight value for all non-zero elements

            - seed: Random seed for reproducible sparse structure generation
        shape : MatrixShape
            The shape of the matrix as a tuple (rows, columns).
        corder : bool, optional
            Memory layout order flag, by default False.

        -----
        The constructor extracts the components from the data tuple and sets them
        as instance attributes. The weight is converted to a JAX array if it's not
        already one, preserving any attached units.

    """
    Just-In-Time Connectivity Homogeneous matrix with Row-oriented representation.

    This class represents a row-oriented homogeneous sparse matrix optimized for JAX-based
    transformations. It follows the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format conceptually, storing
    a uniform weight value for all non-zero elements in the matrix, along with probability
    and seed information to determine the sparse structure.

    The class is designed for efficient neural network connectivity patterns where weights
    are homogeneous (identical) but connectivity is sparse and stochastically determined.
    The row-oriented structure makes row-based operations more efficient than column-based ones.

    Attributes
    ----------
    weight : Union[jax.Array, u.Quantity]
        The homogeneous value used for all non-zero elements in the matrix.
        Can be a plain JAX array or a quantity with units.
    prob : Union[float, jax.Array]
        Probability for each potential connection. Controls the sparsity level
        with 0.0 meaning no connections and 1.0 meaning all possible connections.
    seed : Union[int, jax.Array]
        Random seed used for initialization of the sparse structure.
        Using the same seed produces identical connectivity patterns.
    shape : MatrixShape
        The shape of the matrix as a tuple (rows, cols).
    corder : bool
        Flag indicating the memory layout order of the matrix.
        False (default) for Fortran-order (column-major), True for C-order (row-major).
    dtype
        The data type of the matrix elements (property inherited from parent).

    Notes
    -----
    - JAX PyTree compatible for use with JAX transformations (jit, grad, vmap)
    - More memory-efficient than dense matrices for sparse connectivity patterns
    - Well-suited for neural network connectivity matrices with uniform weights
    - Optimized for matrix-vector operations common in neural simulations
    - The matrix is implicitly constructed based on the probability and seed;
      the actual sparse structure is materialized only when needed
    - When used with units (e.g., u.mV), units are preserved through operations

class JITCHomoC(JITHomoMatrix):
    """
    Just-In-Time Connectivity Homogeneous matrix with Column-oriented representation.

    This class represents a column-oriented homogeneous sparse matrix optimized for JAX-based
    transformations. It follows the Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) format conceptually, storing
    a uniform weight value for all non-zero elements in the matrix, along with probability
    and seed information to determine the sparse structure.

    The column-oriented structure makes column-based operations more efficient than row-based
    ones, making this class the transpose-oriented counterpart to JITCHomoR.

    Attributes
    ----------
    weight : Union[jax.Array, u.Quantity]
        The homogeneous value used for all non-zero elements in the matrix.
        Can be a plain JAX array or a quantity with units.
    prob : Union[float, jax.Array]
        Probability for each potential connection. Controls the sparsity level
        with 0.0 meaning no connections and 1.0 meaning all possible connections.
    seed : Union[int, jax.Array]
        Random seed used for initialization of the sparse structure.
        Using the same seed produces identical connectivity patterns.
    shape : MatrixShape
        The shape of the matrix as a tuple (rows, cols).
    corder : bool
        Flag indicating the memory layout order of the matrix.
        False (default) for Fortran-order (column-major), True for C-order (row-major).
    dtype
        The data type of the matrix elements (property inherited from parent).

    Examples
    --------

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import jax
        >>> import brainunit as u
        >>> from brainevent import JITCHomoC

        # Create a homogeneous matrix with value 1.5, probability 0.1, and seed 42
        >>> homo_matrix = JITCHomoC((1.5, 0.1, 42), shape=(10, 10))
        >>> homo_matrix
        JITCHomoC(shape=(10, 10), weight=1.5, prob=0.1, seed=42, corder=False)

        # Create a matrix with units
        >>> weighted_matrix = JITCHomoC((1.5 * u.mV, 0.1, 42), shape=(10, 10))
        >>> weighted_matrix
        JITCHomoC(shape=(10, 10), weight=1.5 mV, prob=0.1, seed=42, corder=False)

        # Perform matrix-vector multiplication
        >>> vec = jax.numpy.ones(10)
        >>> result = homo_matrix @ vec
        >>> result.shape  # (10,)

        # Apply scalar operations
        >>> scaled = homo_matrix * 2.0
        >>> scaled.weight  # 3.0

        # Arithmetic operations maintain the sparse structure
        >>> neg_matrix = -homo_matrix
        >>> neg_matrix.weight  # -1.5

        # Convert to dense representation
        >>> dense_matrix = homo_matrix.todense()
        >>> dense_matrix.shape  # (10, 10)

        # Transpose operation returns a row-oriented matrix
        >>> row_matrix = homo_matrix.transpose()
        >>> isinstance(row_matrix, JITCHomoR)  # True
        >>> row_matrix.shape  # (10, 10)

    Notes
    -----
    - JAX PyTree compatible for use with JAX transformations (jit, grad, vmap)
    - More memory-efficient than dense matrices for sparse connectivity patterns
    - More efficient than JITCHomoR for column-based operations
    - Well-suited for neural network connectivity matrices with uniform weights
    - Optimized for matrix-vector operations common in neural simulations
    - The matrix is implicitly constructed based on the probability and seed;
      the actual sparse structure is materialized only when needed
    - When used with units (e.g., u.mV), units are preserved through operations

    def todense(self) -> Union[jax.Array, u.Quantity]:
        """
        Converts the sparse column-oriented homogeneous matrix to dense format.

        This method generates a full dense representation of the sparse matrix by
        using the homogeneous weight value for all connections determined by the
        probability and seed. Since this is a column-oriented matrix (JITCHomoC),
        the transpose flag is set to True to ensure proper conversion.

        Returns
        -------
        Union[jax.Array, u.Quantity]
            A dense matrix with the same shape as the sparse matrix. The data type
            will match the weight's data type, and if the weight has units (is a
            u.Quantity), the returned array will have the same units.

        The transpose operation effectively converts between column-oriented and
