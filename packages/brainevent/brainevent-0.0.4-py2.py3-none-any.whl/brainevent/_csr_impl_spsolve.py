def csr_solve(data, indices, indptr, b, tol=1e-6, reorder=1):
    """
    A sparse direct solver using QR factorization.

    Compute

    $$
    M x = b
    $$

    where $M$ is the CSR sparse matrix, and b is the vector.

    Accepts a sparse matrix in CSR format `data, indices, indptr` arrays.
    Currently only the CUDA GPU backend is implemented, the CPU backend will fall
    back to `scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve`. Neither the CPU nor the GPU
    implementation support batching with `vmap`.

    Args:
      data : An array containing the non-zero entries of the CSR matrix.
      indices : The column indices of the CSR matrix.
      indptr : The row pointer array of the CSR matrix.
      b : The right hand side of the linear system.
      tol : Tolerance to decide if singular or not. Defaults to 1e-6.
      reorder : The reordering scheme to use to reduce fill-in. No reordering if
        ``reorder=0``. Otherwise, symrcm, symamd, or csrmetisnd (``reorder=1,2,3``),
        respectively. Defaults to symrcm.

    Returns:
      An array with the same dtype and size as b representing the solution to
      the sparse linear system.
