    Arguments
    ---------
    figure      The matplotlib Figure to save
    filename    The name to use for the files, without extention

    Optional keyword arguments
    --------------------------
    format          The format in which to save the no-text figure.
    widthcommand    The LaTeX length command which will be used to
                    define the width of the figure.
    scale_fontsize  Map the fontsizes in the figure to LaTeX font sizes.
                    If a float is given, the fontsizes are scaled by
                    that value before mapping.
                    If False, no LaTeX font size commands are used.
    draw_anchors    If True, mark the text anchors on the figure.
                    Useful for debugging.
    externalize     Set to True if you want to use tikz externalization.
    verbose: int    0: Print nothing.
                    1: Print save message to stdout. (default)
                    2: Also print runtime info to stderr.
