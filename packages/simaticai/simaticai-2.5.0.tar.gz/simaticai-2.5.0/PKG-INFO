# AI Software Development Kit (Industrial AI Suite) 
## Streamline Industrial AI Development and Deployment
 
The AI Software Development Kit (the `simaticai` Python Package) is a comprehensive Python library designed to simplify the creation, packaging, and testing of AI inference pipelines for the `Industrial AI Suite`. Part of Siemens' Industrial Edge ecosystem, this SDK accelerates the integration of AI solutions into manufacturing environments.

## Key Features 
+ **Complete ML Pipeline Support**: Create and package AI inference pipelines with ease
+ **Notebook-Based Tutorials**: Ready-to-use [End to End Tutorials](https://github.com/industrial-edge/ai-sdk-tutorials/) for model training and deployment
+ **Industrial Edge Integration**: Seamless connectivity with SIMATIC and Industrial Edge infrastructure
+ **Cloud Compatibility**: Native integration with leading cloud-based ML environments (such as [Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/industrial-edge/reference-architecture-for-industrial-ai-on-azure)) <br> 
+ **GPU Acceleration**: Optimized for NVIDIA GPU-powered Industrial PCs 
+ **Production-Ready**: Built for industrial-grade reliability and performance

## Quick Start
The code examples only represent the main steps to create an AI Inference Pipeline using Package simaticai, to enjoy the full experience, please study the [public tutorials](https://github.com/industrial-edge/ai-sdk-tutorials/) or discover the [code repository](https://github.com/industrial-edge/ai-sdk) on Github.

### Create an AI inference pipeline
```python
from simaticai.deployment import PythonComponent, Pipeline
# creating a Pipeline Step for classification
classification = PythonComponent(name="classification")  

# [..] additional steps to add resources and defining the environment

# creating of the Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline("Image Classification")  
# adding the classification step
pipeline.add_component(classification)  

# [..] final steps to define the Pipeline properties and behavior
```

### Package for deployment
```python
# saving the Pipeline for deployment
package_path = pipeline.export("./deploy")
```

## Prerequisites
+ Python >=3.10
+ pip >= 21.3.1 (automatically upgraded during installation)
+ Compatible with Industrial Edge devices
+ NVIDIA GPU support (recommended)
