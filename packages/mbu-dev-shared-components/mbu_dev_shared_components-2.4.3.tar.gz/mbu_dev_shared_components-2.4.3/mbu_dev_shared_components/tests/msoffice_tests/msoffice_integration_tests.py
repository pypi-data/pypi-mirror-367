"""
Integration tests for verifying Microsoft Office Excel functionality through SharePoint.

Tests included:
1. `test_list_files_from_sharepoint_folder`:
   - Verifies that a known test Excel file exists in the SharePoint folder.

2. `test_append_row_to_excel`:
   - Appends a row to a specific sheet in the Excel file.
   - Verifies the row was successfully added.

3. `test_format_and_sort_excel_file`:
   - Sorts the Excel sheet by date/time (descending).
   - Applies formatting (bold headers, auto column widths).
   - Verifies that sorting has changed the order.

Important constants:
- FOLDER_NAME = "MSOffice tests"
- FILE_NAME = "Test_Append_Rows.xlsx"
- SHEET_NAME = "Upload logs"
- HEADERS = ["Upload date", "Upload time"]

Requires environment variables:
- MSOFFICE_USERNAME
- MSOFFICE_PASSWORD
