The official Python SDK for [ExosphereHost](https://exosphere.host) - an open-source infrastructure layer for background AI workflows and agents. This SDK enables you to create distributed, stateful applications using a node-based architecture.

## Overview

ExosphereHost provides a robust, affordable, and effortless infrastructure for building scalable AI workflows and agents. The Python SDK allows you to:

- Create distributed workflows using a simple node-based architecture.
- Build stateful applications that can scale across multiple compute resources.
- Execute complex AI workflows with automatic state management.
- Integrate with the ExosphereHost platform for optimized performance.

## Installation

```bash
pip install exospherehost
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Node Creation

Create a simple node that processes data:

```python
from exospherehost import Runtime, BaseNode
from pydantic import BaseModel

class SampleNode(BaseNode):
    class Inputs(BaseModel):
        name: str
        data: dict

    class Outputs(BaseModel):
        message: str
        processed_data: dict

    async def execute(self) -> Outputs:
        print(f"Processing data for: {self.inputs.name}")
        # Your processing logic here
        processed_data = {"status": "completed", "input": self.inputs.data}
        return self.Outputs(
            message="success", 
            processed_data=processed_data
        )

# Initialize the runtime
Runtime(
    namespace="MyProject", 
    name="DataProcessor",
    nodes=[SampleNode]
).start()
```

## Environment Configuration

The SDK requires the following environment variables for authentication with ExosphereHost:

```bash
export EXOSPHERE_STATE_MANAGER_URI="your-state-manager-uri"
export EXOSPHERE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Key Features

- **Distributed Execution**: Run nodes across multiple compute resources
- **State Management**: Automatic state persistence and recovery
- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic integration for input/output validation
- **Async Support**: Native async/await support for high-performance operations
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error recovery
- **Scalability**: Designed for high-volume batch processing and workflows

## Architecture

The SDK is built around two core concepts:

### Runtime

The `Runtime` class manages the execution environment and coordinates with the ExosphereHost state manager. It handles:

- Node lifecycle management
- State coordination
- Error handling and recovery
- Resource allocation

### Nodes
Nodes are the building blocks of your workflows. Each node:
- Defines input/output schemas using Pydantic models
- Implements an `execute` method for processing logic
- Can be connected to other nodes to form workflows
- Automatically handles state persistence

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Node Configuration

```python
class ConfigurableNode(BaseNode):
    class Inputs(BaseModel):
        text: str
        max_length: int = 100

    class Outputs(BaseModel):
        result: str
        length: int

    async def execute(self) -> Outputs:
        result = self.inputs.text[:self.inputs.max_length]
        return self.Outputs(result=result, length=len(result))
```

### Error Handling

```python
class RobustNode(BaseNode):
    class Inputs(BaseModel):
        data: str

    class Outputs(BaseModel):
        success: bool
        result: str

    async def execute(self) -> Outputs:
        raise Exception("This is a test error")
```
Error handling is automatically handled by the runtime and the state manager.

## Integration with ExosphereHost Platform

The Python SDK integrates seamlessly with the ExosphereHost platform, providing:

- **Performance**: Optimized execution with intelligent resource allocation and parallel processing
- **Reliability**: Built-in fault tolerance, automatic recovery, and failover capabilities
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on workload demands
- **Monitoring**: Integrated logging and monitoring capabilities
