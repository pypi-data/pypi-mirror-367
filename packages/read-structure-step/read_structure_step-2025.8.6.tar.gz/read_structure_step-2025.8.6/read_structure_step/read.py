    Calls the appropriate functions to parse the requested file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_name : str
        Name of the file

    configuration : Configuration
        The SEAMM configuration to read into

    extension : str, optional, default: None
        The extension, including initial dot, defining the format.

    add_hydrogens : bool = False
        Whether to add any missing hydrogen atoms.

    system_db : System_DB = None
        The system database, used if multiple structures in the file.

    system : System = None
        The system to use if adding subsequent structures as configurations.

    indices : str = None
        The generalized indices (slices, SMARTS, etc.) to select structures
        from a file containing multiple structures.

    subsequent_as_configurations : bool = False
        Normally and subsequent structures are loaded into new systems; however,
        if this option is True, they will be added as configurations.

    system_name : str = None
        The name for systems. Can be directives like "SMILES" or
        "Canonical SMILES". If None, no name is given.

    configuration_name : str = None
        The name for configurations. Can be directives like "SMILES" or
        "Canonical SMILES". If None, no name is given.

    printer : Logger or Printer
        A function that prints to the appropriate place, used for progress.

    references : ReferenceHandler = None
        The reference handler object or None

    bibliography : dict
        The bibliography as a dictionary.

    step : seamm.Node = None
        The node in the flowchart, used for running e.g. MOPAC.

    Returns
    -------
    [Configuration]
        The list of configurations created.
