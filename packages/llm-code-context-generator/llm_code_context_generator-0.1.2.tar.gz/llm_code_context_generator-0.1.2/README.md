A powerful command-line tool that scans any project, intelligently filters files, and combines all relevant source code into a single, clean file perfectly formatted for Large
Language Models (LLMs).

---

## The Problem

AI models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini are powerful, but they can't see your entire project. When you ask for help, you often get generic answers because the AI lacks the full
context. Manually copying and pasting code is slow, messy, and nearly impossible for large projects.

## The Solution

**LLM Code Context Generator** fixes this. It walks through your project directory, uses your `.gitignore` file and a custom config to skip irrelevant files, and creates one
single, organized Markdown file.

You can paste this file into your favorite AI chat to give it the deep understanding it needs to provide truly helpful, project-aware answers.

## Key Features

- **üöÄ Fast and Local**: Runs entirely on your machine, ensuring your code stays private and the process is quick.
- **üß† Smart Filtering**: Automatically understands and uses the rules from your project's `.gitignore` file.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Standardized Configuration**: Configure the tool using the standard `pyproject.toml` file, keeping your project root clean.
- **ü§ñ AI-Friendly Format**: The output is clean Markdown with language-specific code blocks, making it easy for LLMs to parse.
- **‚úÖ Easy to Use**: Install with a single command and run it from anywhere on your system.

## Installation

You can install the tool directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install llm-code-context-generator
```

After installation, the `llmcontext` command will be available in your terminal. You may need to restart your terminal for the command to be recognized the first time.

You can verify the installation by checking the help message:

```bash
llmcontext --help
```

## How to Use

Using the tool is simple and straightforward.

### Basic Usage

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project's main folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   llmcontext
   ```

This will scan the current directory and create a context file named `[your-project-name]_context.md`.

### Advanced Usage

#### Scanning a Different Directory

You can scan any project folder without `cd`-ing into it first:

```bash
llmcontext /path/to/another/project
```

#### Specifying an Output File

Use the `-o` or `--output` flag to set a custom name and location for the context file:

```bash
llmcontext . -o my-api-context.md
```

## Configuration (via `pyproject.toml`)

For precise control, you can add a dedicated section to your project's `pyproject.toml` file. The tool will automatically find and use it. This is the recommended way to handle
project-specific configurations, as it keeps your project directory clean and follows modern Python standards.

### Sample Configuration

Add a `[tool.llmcontext]` section to your `pyproject.toml` file like this:

```toml
# In your pyproject.toml file

[tool.llmcontext]
# A list of top-level directories to exclusively include.
# If not empty, only these directories will be scanned.
allowed_dirs = ["src", "app", "core"]

# A list of directory names to ignore everywhere.
ignored_dirs = [
    "tests",
    "docs",
    "assets",
    "migrations"
]

# A list of exact filenames to ignore.
ignored_files = [
    "config.js",
    "docker-compose.yml",
    "manage.py"
]

# A list of file extensions to ignore.
ignored_extensions = [
    ".log",
    ".tmp",
    ".md",
    ".bak"
]
```

### Configuration Keys Explained

- `allowed_dirs`: (Whitelist) An array of strings. If you add folders here (e.g., `"src"`), the tool will **only** look inside those folders at the top level. This is great for
  focusing on just your source code.
- `ignored_dirs`: (Blacklist) An array of strings. The tool will completely skip any folder with these names (e.g., `"tests"`).
- `ignored_files`: (Blacklist) An array of strings. The tool will skip any file that has one of these exact names (e.g., `"docker-compose.yml"`).
- `ignored_extensions`: (Blacklist) An array of strings. The tool will skip any file ending with one of these extensions (e.g., `".log"`, `".md"`).

**Note:** The tool applies ignore rules from `.gitignore` first, then applies the rules from your `pyproject.toml` file for even more control.
