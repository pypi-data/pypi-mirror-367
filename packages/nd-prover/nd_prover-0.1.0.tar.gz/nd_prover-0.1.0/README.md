# ND-Prover

An interactive Fitch-style natural deduction proof checker, implemented in Python.

Supports propositional, first-order, and modal logics (K, T, S4, S5) via a command-line interface.


## Logic Checklist

- [x] Propositional logic (TFL)
- [x] First-order logic (FOL)
- [x] Modal logic K (MLK)
- [x] Modal logic T (MLT)
- [x] Modal logic S4 (MLS4)
- [x] Modal logic S5 (MLS5)


## Example Usage

```
$ python -m nd_prover
Select logic (TFL, FOL, MLK, MLT, MLS4, MLS5): TFL
Enter premises (separated by "," or ";"): P -> Q, P
Enter conclusion: Q

 1 | P → Q      PR
 2 | P          PR
   |---

1 - Add a new line
2 - Begin a new subproof
3 - End the current subproof
4 - End the current subproof and begin a new one
5 - Delete the last line

Select action: 1
Enter line: Q ; ->E, 1,2

 1 | P → Q      PR
 2 | P          PR
   |---
 3 | Q          →E, 1,2
