## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [conduct@pilottai.com](mailto:conduct@pilottai.com).

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pilottai-tools.git
   cd pilottai-tools
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   base venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install dependencies
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

â””â”€â”€ tests/           # Test suite
```

## Development Process

### Creating a Branch

- Create branches from `main` for all changes
- Use meaningful branch names following this pattern:
  - `feature/description` for new features
  - `fix/description` for bug fixes
  - `docs/description` for documentation changes
  - `refactor/description` for code refactoring

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Making Changes

1. Make focused, incremental changes
2. Follow the [coding standards](#coding-standards)
3. Update tests and documentation as needed
4. Commit regularly with clear messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new agent capability"
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in task router"
```

### Testing

1. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

2. **Test Coverage**
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest --cov=pilottai-tools tests/
   ```

3. **Type Checking**
   ```bash
   poetry run mypy pilottai-tools
   ```

### Documentation

- Update relevant documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Include usage examples for new features

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before Submitting**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Check code coverage
   - Run linting and type checking
   - Update documentation
   - Rebase on latest main

2. **PR Template**
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link related issues
   - Describe your changes thoroughly
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

3. **Review Process**
   - At least one maintainer review is required
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Keep PR scope focused

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use descriptive variable names

### Code Quality

```python
# Good Example
async def process_task(task: Task) -> TaskResult:
    """Process a task and return its result.

    Args:
        task: The task to process

    Returns:
        TaskResult: The result of task processing
    """
    try:
        result = await self._execute_task_steps(task)
        return TaskResult(success=True, output=result)
    except Exception as e:
        return TaskResult(success=False, error=str(e))
```

### Testing Standards

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Use meaningful test names and descriptions

```python
async def test_task_processing_success():
    """Test successful task processing with valid input."""
    task = Task(description="test task")
    result = await agent.process_task(task)
    assert result.success
    assert result.output is not None
```
