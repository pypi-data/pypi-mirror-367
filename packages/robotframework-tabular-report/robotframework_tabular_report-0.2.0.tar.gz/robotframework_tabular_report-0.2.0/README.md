# Robot Framework Tabular Report

[![Upload Python Package](https://github.com/p-zander/robotframework-tabular-report/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/p-zander/robotframework-tabular-report/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml)

## Overview

**Robot Framework Tabular Report** is a small extension for Robot Framework that generates tabular test reports alongside the regular output files, for easier overview and to make them more accessible. The tabular test report can be generated in different formats, currently CSV and Excel.

## Features

- Generates test results in a tabular format
- Supports multiple file formats: CSV, XLSX
- Easy integration with Robot Framework
- Customizable columns and report content
- Customizable formatting (only XLSX)

## Installation

```bash
pip install robotframework-tabular-report
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

The Writers provided by this library can easily be utilized using the `--prerebotmodifier` option (see ["3.6.9   Programmatic modification of results"](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#programmatic-modification-of-results) in Documentation) either directly during the test execution

```bash
robot --prerebotmodifier CsvWriter:myfile my_tests
```

or afterwards using existing test results:

```bash
rebot --prerebotmodifier XlsWriter:workbook output.xml
```

## Configuration

You can customize the columns and formatting in the command line. All writers support the following parameters:

- `output_filename`: Name for the output file without extension (mandatory argument)
- `format_specifier`: Select test result properties for the output (See [Format Specifiers](#format-specifiers)) 
- `docs_max_len`: When writing Test/Suite documentation to output, limit length (default: 100)

### CsvWriter

Additionally this Writer support the following arguments:

- `delim`: Delimeter (one character) to use in CSV file, use special value "TAB" to generate a Tab-separated file (default: `,`)

### XlsWriter

Additionally this Writer support the following arguments:

- `colored_status`: Use conditional formatting to color red/green in test status column (Truthy/Falsy, default: `True`)
- `colored_rows`: Color complete test case row read/green depending on test status (Truthy/Falsy, default: `False`)

Note: The formatting based on test status is only supported, when the `status` field is present in the output.$

### Details

The arguments need to be provided in order, following the modifier name and separated by `:`, all parameters other then the filename are optional. When needing to set a letter parameter, whil leaving a earlier on at its default value the value can be skipped (empty assignment, i.e. `::`).

**Example:**
```
robot --prerebotmodifier CsvWriter:myfile:name,status,parent.metadata,tags::TAB my_tests
```
This would create a Tab-separated file ``myfile.csv``, with the provided fields and the default doc length.

**Example 2:**
```
robot --prerebotmodifier XlsWriter:workbook::::Yes my_tests
```
This would create a Excel file ``workbook.xlsx``, with the default fields and formatting (red/green) applied to each row depending on the test status.

## Format Specifiers

The format specifiers are expected to be one of the properties of the [TestCase](https://robot-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autodoc/robot.result.html#robot.result.model.TestCase) result model or the [TestSuite](https://robot-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autodoc/robot.result.html#robot.result.model.TestSuite) result model, accessible via the `parent` field. This includes, but might not be limited to:

|Fields|Comments|

| `(parent.)has_teardown`   |  If Test Case/Suite has a teardown defined           |
| `(parent.)id`             |  Automatically set Id                                |
| `(parent.)message`        |  Test Message of Test Case/Suite if set              |
| `(parent.)name`           |  Name of the Test Case/Suite                         |
| `(parent.)not_run`        |  Representation of "NOT RUN" status as Bool          |
| `(parent.)passed`         |  Representation of "PASS" status as Bool             |
| `(parent.)setup`          |  Keyword name for Test Case/Suite setup if set       |
| `(parent.)skipped`        |  Representation of "SKIP" status as Bool             |
| `(parent.)source`         |  Path to source file of Test Case/Suite              |
| `(parent.)starttime`      |  Timestamp of Test Case/Suite start                  |
| `(parent.)status`         |  Test Case/Suite result                              |
| `(parent.)teardown`       |  Keyword name for Test Case/Suite teardown if set    |
| `body`                    |  Test Case content as parsed from source file        |
| `lineno`                  |  Line number to Test Case definition in source file  |
| `parent.all_tests`        |  List of all Test Cases in Suite                     |
| `parent.full_message`     |  Combination of message and stat_message             |
| `parent.has_tests`        |  If Test Suite is empty                              |
| `parent.metadata`         |  Free suite metadata if set (list of tuples)         |
| `parent.stat_message`     |  Test Suite statistics as String                     |
| `parent.test_count`       |  Number of all Test Cases in Suite                   |
| `tags`                    |  Test Case Tags                                      |
| `timeout`                 |  Test Case Timeout                                   |

The **Default format** would be equivalent to the following specifier:
```full_name,doc,tags,status,message,elapsedtime,starttime,endtime```

When using the special value `LONG` for the `format_specifier` argument, this library provides another pre-configured format, which is equivalent to:
```id,parent.name,name,parent.metadata,doc,tags,status,message,elapsedtime,starttime,endtime,timeout,source,lineno```

Just did some quick testing on all other parameters listed here and found no issues. With members that aren't not listed your kilometerage may vary. Accessing grandparent members is not possible currently.

Examples files as well as my basis for testing can be found in the `test` folder.
