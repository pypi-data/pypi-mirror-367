"SNITIZE" is a lightweight Python library for sanitizing and validating user input strings.

It is designed to be used in security-related projects where untrusted input must be filtered or cleaned before further processing.

This library removes potentially dangerous characters and patterns from user input, helping to prevent injection attacks or other forms of abuse.

Use it when handling data from forms, APIs, or any external source.
