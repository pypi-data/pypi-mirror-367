        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of relationships
            between a single nutrient (including vitamins,
            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            disease. A disease is any abnormal health condition
            (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus,
            rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell anemia, Barth syndrome).
            Provide the full text from the input text describing the relationship
            without changes or summarization. Include all numbered inline
            references contained in the sentences without changes.
            Do not include newlines. If multiple sentences describe the
            same relationship, include all of them.
            If the text describes a one-to-many relationship, include
            all of them separately. For example, "Vitamin A is associated with
            Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis (5,6)"
            should be "Vitamin A is associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (5,6);
            Vitamin A is associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis (5,6)".
            Use the same description of the relationship as in the input text.
            For example, if the input text states "Iron supplementation
            was shown to successfully treat anemia (5,6)", the output should be
            "Iron supplementation treats anemia (5,6)". Other potential
            relationships include "ameliorates" or "prevents".
          prompt.examples: >-
            Evidence suggests that high-dose Vitamin A treatment may prevent Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (5,6). Further studies confirmed this finding (7); Studies have shown that Vitamin A is associated with bone cancer (8).

        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of relationships
            between a single nutrient (including vitamins,
            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            biological phenotype, with a type of relationship
            connecting them both. A phenotype is an observable
            physical or behavioral trait or symptom (e.g., fever,
            headache, short attention span, petechiae,
            telangiectasia). It may or may not be associated
            with a disease. Phenotypes do NOT include high-level
            biological processes such as "Insulin signaling" or "lipid
            metabolism", developmental processes such as "limb development",
            or health states such as "healthy teeth".
            Provide the full text from the input text describing the relationship
            without changes or summarization. Include all numbered inline
            references contained in the sentences without changes.
            Do not include newlines. If multiple sentences describe the
            same relationship, include all of them.
            If the text describes a one-to-many relationship, include

            fever and headache (5,6)" should be "Vitamin A is associated with fever (5,6);
            Vitamin A is associated with headache (5,6)".
            Use the same description of the relationship as in the input text.

            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            biological process, with a type of relationship
            connecting them both. A biological process is an
            activity or series of activities that occur in a
            cell or organism, such as "nuclear axial expansion",
            "intracellular transport", "ribosomal subunit export from nucleus",
            "insulin signaling", or "DNA repair".
            Biological processes do NOT include health states such as
            "healthy teeth" or proteins such as "retinoic acid receptor".
            Provide the full text from the input text describing the relationship
            without changes or summarization. Include all numbered inline
            references contained in the sentences without changes.

            Use the same description of the relationship as in the input text.
            For example, if the input text states "Vitamin A is a participant in
            Insulin Signaling (5,6)", the output should be
            "Vitamin A participates in Insulin Signaling (5,6)". Other potential
            relationships include "is input of", "is output of", "catalyzes",
            "is substrate of", "involved in", and "enables". 
          prompt.examples: >-

            part or system of the body, with a type of relationship
            connecting them both. Example parts or systems include
            "teeth", "skin", "cardiovascular system", "digestive system",
            or "liver". Transform names of processes
            to their respective anatomy, e.g., "thyroid function" or
            "thyroid health" should be changed to "thyroid"; "digestion"
            should be changed to "digestive system".
            Provide the full text from the input text describing the relationship
            without changes or summarization. Include all numbered inline

            healthy teeth (5,6); Vitamin A is associated with healthy skin (5,6)".
            Use the same description of the relationship as in the input text.
            For example, if the input text states "Vitamin A levels are
            necessary for healthy teeth (5,6)", the output should be
            "Vitamin A participates in the health of teeth (5,6)". Other potential

            butter and apple (5,6)" should be "Vitamin A is associated with
            butter (5,6); Vitamin A is associated with apple (5,6)".
            These relationships may require some processing, e.g.,
            "Vitamin A is found in butter (5,6)" should be
            "Vitamin A is a nutrient of butter (5,6)".
          prompt.examples: >-

            Vitamin D (5,6); Vitamin A is associated with Vitamin E (5,6)".
            Use the same description of the relationship as in the input text.
            For example, if the input text states "Vitamin A participates in
