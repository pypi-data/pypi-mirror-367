    This function is used to convert old Tyche data to the modern data management standard. This is used to make the

    Notes:
        This function is statically written to work with the raw Tyche dataset featured in the OSM manuscript:
        https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08548-w. Additionally, it assumes that the dataset has been
        preprocessed with the early Sun lab mesoscope compression pipeline. The function will not work for any other
        project or data hierarchy.

        As part of its runtime, the function automatically transfers the ascended session data to the BioHPC server.
        Since transferring the data over the network is the bottleneck of this pipeline, it runs in a single-threaded
        mode and is constrained by the communication channel between the local machine and the BioHPC server. Calling
        this function for a large number of sessions will result in a long processing time due to the network data
        transfer.

        Since SessionData can only be created on a PC that has a valid acquisition system config, this function will
        only work on a machine that is part of an active Sun lab acquisition system.
