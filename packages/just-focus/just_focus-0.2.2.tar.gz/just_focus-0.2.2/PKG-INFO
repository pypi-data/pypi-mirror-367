# Just Focus

Just Focus is a Python package for computing vectorial electromagnetic fields in the focus of high numerical aperture microscope objectives.

## Quickstart

Compute the field in the focal plane (z = 0.0) of a NA 1.4 oil immersion microscope objective assuming a linearly polarized, paraxial Gaussian beam with a waist size equal to the radius of the objective's back aperture. Use a hyperbolic tangent function to smooth the boundary of the stop and zero pad the mesh so that the final square mesh has 64 * 2^4 = 1024 samples in each direction.

```python
import numpy as np

from leb.just_focus import InputField, Polarization, Pupil, Stop

mesh_size = 64
pupil = Pupil(
    na=1.4,
    refractive_index=1.518,
    wavelength_um=0.561,
    mesh_size=mesh_size,
    stop=Stop.TANH,
)

inputs = InputField.gaussian_pupil(
    beam_center=(0.0, 0.0),
    waist=1.0,
    mesh_size=mesh_size,
    polarization=Polarization.LINEAR_Y,
)

results = pupil.propgate(0.0, inputs, padding_factor=4)
```

## Installation

```console
pip install just-focus
```

### Extras

Install additional dependencies for making plots:

```console
pip install just-focus[plot]
```

## Development

### Set up the development environment

Development requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

After cloning this repo, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```console
uv sync --all-extras
```

This will create a virtual environment with the required dependencies in a folder named `.venv`.

### Tests

Just run `pytest` from the project's root directory:

```console
pytest
```
