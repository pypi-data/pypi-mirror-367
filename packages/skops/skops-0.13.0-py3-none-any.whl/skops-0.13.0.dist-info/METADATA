SKOPS
=====

``skops`` is a Python library helping you share your `scikit-learn
<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`__ based models and put them in production.
At the moment, it includes `skops.io` to securely persist sklearn estimators and
more, without using ``pickle``. It also includes `skops.card` to create a model
card explaining what the model does and how it should be used.

- ``skops.io``: Secure persistence of sklearn estimators and more, without using
  ``pickle``. Visit `the docs
  <https://skops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/persistence.html>`__ for more
  information.
- ``skops.card``: tools to create a model card explaining what the model does
  and how it should be used. The model card can then be stored as the
  ``README.md`` file on the Hugging Face Hub, with pre-populated metadata to
  help Hub understand the model. More information can be found `here
  <https://skops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/model_card.html>`__.

Please refer to our `documentation <https://skops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
on using the library as user, which includes user guides on the above topics as
well as complete examples explaining how the features can be used.

If you want to contribute to the library, please refer to our `contributing
<CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ guidelines.

Installation
------------

You can install this library using:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install skops
