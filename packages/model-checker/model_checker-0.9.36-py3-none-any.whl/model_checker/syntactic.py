"""
This module provides the core syntactic components for logical formula processing and
operator management in the model checker. It defines five main classes:

    - Sentence: Represents logical formulas and handles their transformation between
      infix and prefix notation. It maintains all metadata needed for evaluation,
      including operator linkages, semantic bindings, and proposition values.

    - Operator: Abstract base class for all logical operators. Defines the interface
      for operator behavior and provides common functionality for instantiation,
      equality testing, and result visualization.

    - DefinedOperator: Extends Operator to support complex operators that can be
      expressed in terms of more primitive ones. Ensures proper validation of
      operator definitions and arity matching.

    - OperatorCollection: Registry and management system for all logical operators.
      Provides methods for operator registration, lookup, and application while
      ensuring operator uniqueness and proper typing.

    - Syntax: Orchestrates the parsing and structuring of logical arguments.
      Processes premises and conclusions, builds a comprehensive sentence hierarchy,
      validates operator dependencies, and prepares the logical structure for
      semantic evaluation.

The module forms the foundation for translating user-input logical formulas into
a structured representation that can be evaluated by the model checker's semantic
components. It ensures proper typing, handles operator definitions, and validates
the logical structure before semantic processing begins.
