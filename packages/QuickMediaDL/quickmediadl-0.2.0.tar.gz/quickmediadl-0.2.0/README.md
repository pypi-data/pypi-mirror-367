# Progress and Logging
The library uses `tqdm` to display a progress bar during downloads, giving you real-time feedback on the download process. Additionally, a custom logger (`Logger` class) is used for handling debug, warning, and error messages.

# Example
Here’s an example of downloading a video in `720p`, saving it to a custom directory with subtitles in English and Persian, and using a custom filename:

```python
from QuickMediaDL import VideoDownloader

# Initialize downloader with URL
url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example"
downloader = VideoDownloader(url, download_path="my_downloads")

# Download video in 720p quality with specified subtitle languages
downloader.download_video(quality="720p", filename="MyCustomVideo", subtitle_langs=["en", "fa"])
```
