## About Karva

Karva aims to be an efficient alternative to `pytest` and `unittest`.

While we do not yet support all of pytest's features, we aim to gradually add support for pytest alternatives as we add features.

## Getting started

### Installation

Karva is available as [`karva`](https://pypi.org/project/karva/) on PyPI.

Use karva directly with `uvx`:

```bash
uvx karva test
uvx karva version
```

Or install karva with `uv`, or `pip`:

```bash
# With uv.
uv tool install karva@latest

# Add karva to your project.
uv add --dev karva

# With pip.
pip install karva
```

### Usage

By default, Karva will respect your `.gitignore` files when discovering tests in specified directories.

To run your tests, try any of the following:

```bash
# Run all tests.
karva test

# Run tests in a specific directory.
karva test tests/

# Run tests in a specific file.
karva test tests/test_example.py
```

#### Example

Here is a small example usage

**tests/test.py**
```py
def test_pass():
    assert True


def test_fail():
    assert False, "This test should fail"


def test_error():
    raise ValueError("This is an error")
```

Running karva:

```bash
uv run karva test tests/test.py
```

Provides the following output:

```bash
fail[assertion-failed]
 --> test_fail at tests/test.py:5
 | File "tests/test.py", line 6, in test_fail
 |   assert False, "This test should fail"

error[value-error]
 --> test_error at tests/test.py:9
 | File "tests/test.py", line 10, in test_error
 |   raise ValueError("This is an error")

Passed tests: 1
Failed tests: 1
Errored tests: 1
```
