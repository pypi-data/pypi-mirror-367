`sim-tools` is being developed to support Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) and Monte-Carlo Simulation education and applied simulation research.  It is MIT licensed and freely available to practitioners, students and researchers via [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/sim-tools/) and [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sim-tools)

## Vision for sim-tools

 1. Deliver high quality reliable code for DES and Monte-Carlo Simulation education and practice with full documentation.
 2. Provide a simple to use pythonic interface.
 3. To improve the quality of simulation education using FOSS tools and encourage the use of best practice.

## Features:

1. Implementation of classic Optimisation via Simulation procedures such as KN, KN++, OBCA and OBCA-m
2. Theoretical and empirical distributions module that includes classes that encapsulate a random number stream, seed, and distribution parameters.
3. An extendable Distribution registry that provides a quick reproduible way to parameterise simulation models.
4. Implementation of Thinning to sample from Non-stationary Poisson Processes (time-dependent) in a DES.
5. Automatic selection of the number of replications to run via the Replications Algorithm.
6. EXPERIMENTAL: model trace functionality to support debugging of simulation models.

## Installation

### Pip and PyPi

```bash
pip install sim-tools
```

### Conda-forge

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge sim-tools
```

### Mamba

`mamba` is a FOSS alternative to `conda` that is also quicker at resolving and installing environments.

```bash
mamba install sim-tools
```

### Binder
