"""
PyTestLab: Parallel Measurement Example
========================================

This example demonstrates the new parallel task execution feature of the
MeasurementSession. It simulates a common real-world scenario: characterizing
a device's response (e.g., ripple voltage) while its power supply and load
are dynamically changing.

Workflow:
1. A Power Supply (`psu`) ramps its voltage up and down in the background.
2. A DC Electronic Load (`load`) applies a pulsed load current in the background.
3. While these two tasks run concurrently, an Oscilloscope (`scope`) repeatedly
   acquires waveforms.

This entire process is managed declaratively using the MeasurementSession builder.
