    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we've explored PyTestLab's Record & Replay functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Recording**: Captured real instrument interactions using `SessionRecordingBackend`  \n",
    "✅ **Replaying**: Validated exact sequence reproduction using `ReplayBackend`  \n",
    "✅ **Validation**: Demonstrated automatic detection of sequence deviations  \n",
    "✅ **CLI Integration**: Showed command-line workflow for production use  \n",
    "✅ **Best Practices**: Covered recommendations for effective replay system usage  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits Achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🎯 Reproducibility**: Exact measurement sequences can be repeated indefinitely\n",
    "- **🛡️ Integrity**: Scripts cannot accidentally deviate from validated procedures  \n",
    "- **🔬 Offline Analysis**: Complex measurements run without physical instruments\n",
    "- **🧪 Regression Testing**: Automated validation of measurement procedure consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try recording your own measurement procedures with real instruments\n",
    "2. Integrate replay validation into your testing workflows  \n",
    "3. Explore multi-instrument session recording for complex setups\n",
    "4. Set up automated regression testing using recorded sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Record & Replay system provides a powerful foundation for reproducible, validated measurement automation in PyTestLab! 🚀"
