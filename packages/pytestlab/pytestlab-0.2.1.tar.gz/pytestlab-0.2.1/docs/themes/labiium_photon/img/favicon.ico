This is a placeholder text file. A real favicon.ico should be a binary image file.

To create a proper favicon:
1. Design a small icon (16x16, 32x32, or 48x48 pixels) that represents PyTestLab
2. Use an icon generator tool to create a .ico file
3. Replace this text file with the actual .ico file

For the LABIIUM photonic glass morphism style, consider using violet and aqua colors
from the brand palette with a minimal, geometric design.
