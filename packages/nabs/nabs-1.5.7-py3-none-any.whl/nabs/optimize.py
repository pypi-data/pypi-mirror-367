    Use golden-section search to find the extrema of a signal

    The algorithm is fed the starting range in which the extrema is contained
    within and a tolerance in which we would like to know the position of the
    extrema. For the algorithm to succeed it is a requirement that the
    underlying distribution is unimodal. After beginning the scan, "probe"
    points will be chosen to help determine how to narrow the range which
    contains the extrema. These probes are chosen using the golden ratio so the
    scan will complete in a deterministic number of iterations based on the
    starting range and desired resolution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : `ophyd.signal.Signal`
        Signal whose distribution we are investigating

    motor : `ophyd.ophydobj.OphydObject`
        Object that is ``set`` to probe different points of the distribution.

    tolerance : float
        The size of the range we would like to narrow the position of our
        extrema. Note that this is not the tolerance that we will know the
        "value" of the extrema, but instead the resolution we will be sure that
        it lies within on the "x" axis

    limits : tuple
        Starting bounds that we know the extrema lie within

    average : int, optional
        Option to average the signal we are reading to limit the affect of
        noise on our measurements

    Returns
    -------
    bounds : tuple
        The range in which we have determined the extrema to lie within.
