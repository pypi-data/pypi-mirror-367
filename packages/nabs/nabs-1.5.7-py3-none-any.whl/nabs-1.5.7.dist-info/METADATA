# nabs
Not a Beamline Scientist

This is the landing site for shared code that interfaces with bluesky and
pcdsdaq for beamline automation and data collection routines for LCLS photon
science.

It is named NABS, Not a Beamline Scientist, because it is the go-to when the
question is "Who should be doing this procedure?" and the answer is "Not a
Beamline Scientist!", e.g. it is something that should not be done by hand.
