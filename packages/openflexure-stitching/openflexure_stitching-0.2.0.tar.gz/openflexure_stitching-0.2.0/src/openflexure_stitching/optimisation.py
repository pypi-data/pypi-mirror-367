    Placing N images such that the pair-wise displacements match those measured

    measured displacement, it can be written as a dot product between a vector
    with exactly two nonzero elements (one +1 and one -1) and the position
    vector.

    This function calculates a matrix A such that each row of A is such a vector,
    and then uses that, together with the measured displacements, to recover the
    positions. In order to make sure the problem is constrained, we add an
    extra two rows, constraining the mean position to be zero. We could trivially
    modify this to set an arbitrary mean position.

    have a problem. `fallback_pairs` allows us to pass in additional pair data
