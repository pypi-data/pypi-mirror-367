    ## Aggregation

    In addition to the metric instruments, the concept of aggregations is an
    important one to understand. An aggregation is a technique whereby a large
    number of measurements are combined into either exact or estimated statistics
    about metric events that took place during a time window. The OTLP protocol
    transports such aggregated metrics. The OpenTelemetry API provides a default
    aggregation for each instrument which can be overridden using the Views. The
    OpenTelemetry project aims to provide default aggregations that are supported by
    visualizers and telemetry backends.

    Unlike request tracing, which is intended to capture request
    lifecycles and provide context to the individual pieces of a request, metrics
    are intended to provide statistical information in aggregate. Some examples of
    use cases for metrics include:

    - Reporting the total number of bytes read by a service, per protocol type.
    - Reporting the total number of bytes read and the bytes per request.
    - Reporting th...
