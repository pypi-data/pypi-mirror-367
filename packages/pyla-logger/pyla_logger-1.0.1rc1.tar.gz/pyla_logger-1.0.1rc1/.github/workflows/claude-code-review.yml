            Please review only the code changes in this pull request and provide feedback.

            IMPORTANT: Check the current CI status first. If all CI checks are passing (SUCCESS), ignore any historical comments about code quality failures. Only address current, real issues.

            Focus on:
            - Code quality and Python best practices
            - Security vulnerabilities and potential issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Adherence to the project's coding standards in CLAUDE.md
            - Python library best practices
            - Type safety and proper type annotations
            - Async/await patterns and error handling

            Consider the project context:
            - This is a Python 3.12 structured logging library
            - Provides structured logging capabilities using structlog
            - Simple, focused logging library for Python applications
            - Follows strict typing with pyright
            - Uses black for formatting, flake8 for linting, and pytest for testing
