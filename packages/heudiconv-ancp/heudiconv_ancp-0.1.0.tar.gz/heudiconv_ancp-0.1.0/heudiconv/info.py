## About this fork

This is **not the official version of HeuDiConv**.  
It is a customized fork developed at the *Applied Neurocognitive Psychology Lab*, aimed at improving compatibility and usability in specific workflows.

In particular, this variant offers **full support for Windows environments** and **removes file-writing restrictions** present in the original version, making it more flexible for local pipelines and GUI-based tools.

All credits for the original development go to the NiPy community. This version is provided under the same [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE) and is intended for specialized use cases.


Convert DICOM dirs based on heuristic info - HeuDiConv
uses the dcmstack package and dcm2niix tool to convert DICOM directories or
tarballs into collections of NIfTI files following pre-defined heuristic(s)."""
