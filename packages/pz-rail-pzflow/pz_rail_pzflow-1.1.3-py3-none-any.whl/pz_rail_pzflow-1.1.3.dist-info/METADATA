# RAIL: Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers

RAIL is a flexible software library providing tools to produce at-scale
photometric redshift data products, including uncertainties and summary
statistics, and stress-test them under realistically complex systematics.
A detailed description of RAIL's modular structure is available in the 
[Overview](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/overview.html) 
on ReadTheDocs.

RAIL serves as the infrastructure supporting many extragalactic applications 
of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory,
including Rubin-wide commissioning activities. RAIL was initiated by the
Photometric Redshifts (PZ) Working Group (WG) of the LSST Dark Energy Science 
Collaboration (DESC) as a result of the lessons learned from the 
[Data Challenge 1 (DC1) experiment](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/499/2/1587/5905416) 
to enable the PZ WG Deliverables in 
[the LSST-DESC Science Roadmap (see Sec. 5.18)](https://lsstdesc.org/assets/pdf/docs/DESC_SRM_latest.pdf), 
aiming to guide the selection and implementation of redshift estimators in DESC
analysis pipelines. RAIL is developed and maintained by a diverse team
comprising DESC Pipeline Scientists (PSs), international in-kind contributors,
LSST Interdisciplinary Collaboration for Computing (LINCC) Frameworks software
engineers, and other volunteers, but all are welcome to join the team
regardless of LSST data rights. 

## Installation

Installation instructions are available under 
[Installation](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/installation.html)
on ReadTheDocs.

## Contributing

The greatest strength of RAIL is its extensibility; those interested in
contributing to RAIL should start by consulting the 
[Contributing guidelines](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/contributing.html)
on ReadTheDocs.

## Citing RAIL

RAIL is open source and may be used according to the terms of its

If you make use of the ideas or software here in any publication, you must cite
this repository <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL> as "LSST-DESC PZ WG (in prep)" 
with the [Zenodo DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7017551).
Please consider also inviting the developers as co-authors on publications
resulting from your use of RAIL by 
[making an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL/issues/new/choose).
Additionally, several of the codes accessible through the RAIL ecosystem must 
be cited if used in a publication. A convenient list of what to cite may be found under
