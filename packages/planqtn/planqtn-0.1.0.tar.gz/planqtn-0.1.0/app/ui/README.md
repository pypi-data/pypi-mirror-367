# Tensor Network Quantum Error Correction UI

A modern, interactive web interface for designing and analyzing quantum error
correction codes using tensor networks.

## Features

- **Interactive Canvas**: Drag-and-drop interface for placing and connecting
  quantum error correction components (LEGOs)
- **Component Library**: Pre-built collection of tensor network components with
  detailed properties
- **Network Analysis**: Real-time calculation of parity check matrices for
  connected components
- **Advanced Selection Tools**:
    - Single-click selection for individual LEGOs
    - Box selection for multiple components
    - Network selection for connected components
- **Smart Connections**:
    - Visual connection system with numbered legs
    - Intuitive drag-and-drop connection creation
    - Double-click to remove connections
- **Multi-Selection Operations**:
    - Group movement of selected components
    - Bulk deletion
    - Network-aware operations
- **History Management**:
    - Undo/Redo support (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
    - State preservation in URL for sharing
- **Visual Feedback**:
    - Hover effects for interactive elements
    - Visual indicators for selection state
    - Clear feedback for canvas boundaries
- **Example Library**: Pre-built examples including:
    - Surface code from [[5,1,2]] LEGOs
    - Bacon-Shor code
    - Steane code from [[6,0,2]] LEGOs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Usage

### Basic Operations

1. **Adding Components**:

    - Drag components from the left panel onto the canvas
    - Shift+drag to create copies of existing components

2. **Making Connections**:

    - Drag from one leg to another to create connections
    - Numbers indicate leg indices
    - Double-click connections to remove them

3. **Selection**:

    - Click to select individual components
    - Click and drag on canvas to create selection box
    - Click selected component again to select its network

4. **Movement**:

    - Drag components to move them
    - Selected groups move together

5. **Analysis**:
    - Select a connected network to view its properties
    - Calculate parity check matrix for selected networks
    - Export configurations to Python code

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Z`: Undo last action
- `Ctrl+Y` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z`: Redo last action
- `Delete`: Remove selected components
- `Shift` (while dragging): Create copy of component

## Development

The UI is built with:

- React for component management
- Chakra UI for styling and components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Axios for API communication
