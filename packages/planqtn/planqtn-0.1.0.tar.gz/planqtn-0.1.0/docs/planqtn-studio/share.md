# Sharing tensor networks

As PlanqTN stores the canvas information locally in the browser, all the sharing
options as of now are cloning based. From the
[Share menu on the canvas](./ui-controls.md#sharing-the-canvas), one can

-   Share/save the canvas as JSON file and then in the
    [Canvas menu](./ui-controls.md#canvas-menu) it can be reimported into a new
    canvas
-   Share/bookmark the canvas as a URL - this will create a new canvas every
    time when opened.
-   Export as SVG from the [Canvas menu](./ui-controls.md#canvas-menuexport)
