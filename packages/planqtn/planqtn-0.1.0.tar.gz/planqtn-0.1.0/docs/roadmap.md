# PlanqTN version roadmap

This version roadmap is completely subject to change, but we are sharing our
plans to be transparent about of what's left until we hit the desired level of
completeness of the feature set relative to the original papers, which will mark
the 1.0.0.

-   0.1.0 - The current release. See [Features](./features.md)
-   0.2.0 -
    [Optimize contraction for stabilizer codes and have a citable code page](https://github.com/planqtn/planqtn/milestone/4)
-   0.3.0 -
    [Scale, optimize and share research](https://github.com/planqtn/planqtn/milestone/2) -
    This release enables researchers to create larger networks visually using
    automations and a more optimized UI engine, as well as aim to have
    significantly more optimized GPU based tensor network contraction for weight
    enumerator calculations.
-   1.0.0 -
    [Beyond Paulis, trivial cosets and qubits](https://github.com/planqtn/planqtn/milestone/3) -
    This release implements other features of the quantum lego framework,
    including non-Pauli symmetries (both UI and lib), coset enumerators (for the
    UI) and qudit support (UI + lib).
