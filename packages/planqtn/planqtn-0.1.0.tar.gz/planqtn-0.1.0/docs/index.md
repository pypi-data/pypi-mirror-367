PlanqTN is the [`planqtn`](https://pypyi.org/planqtn) python library and the
[PlanqTN Studio (https://planqtn.com)](https://planqtn.com), an interactive
studio to create, manipulate and analyze tensor network-based quantum error
correcting codes.

The name is a triple entendre on Planck, quantum and Tensor Networks (TN). It is
pronounced "plankton", and was inspired by the fact that each of the little
tensors look like a unique plankter. Also, while we love the quantum LEGO name,
we did not want to get into trademark problems.

The features are an implementation of the
[quantum LEGO framework by Charles Cao and Brad Lackey](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.020332)
and the
[quantum LEGO expansion pack: enumerators from tensor networks by Cao, Gullans, Lackey and Wang](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.030313),
but we also integrate with features that automate tensor network contraction
with [Cotengra](https://cotengra.readthedocs.io/) and take a unified approach to
quantum LEGO, ZX calculus and graph states. Check out the detailed list of
[PlanqTN features](features.md)!

PlanqTN is open source under Apache 2.0 license and free for all, built with ❤️
by [@balopat](https://github.com/balopat), June Vanlerberghe and hopefully a lot
more future collaborators under the guiding council of Charles Cao, Brad Lackey,
and Kenneth R. Brown. If building tools like this sounds like fun to you, please
consider [contributing](contributing.md)!
