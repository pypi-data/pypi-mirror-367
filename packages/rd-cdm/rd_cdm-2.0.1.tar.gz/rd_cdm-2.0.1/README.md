## Project Description

The ontology-based rare disease common data model (RD-CDM) is designed to 
harmonize rare disease data capture across international registries. It 
integrates standards such as the ERDRI-CDS, HL7 FHIR, and GA4GH Phenopacket 
Schema, creating a scalable, ontology-driven framework that supports advanced 
interoperability for research and care. The RD-CDM Version 2.0.0 consists of 
78 data elements, extending the ERDRI-CDS and allowing deeper insights into 
genetic findings, phenotypic features, and family history of individuals.

## Features

- Interoperability: Aligns with HL7 FHIR v4.0.1 and GA4GH Phenopacket v2.0 for
    structured data exchange.
- Ontology-driven: Utilizes ontologies such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, MONDO, OMIM, 
    and HPO for standardizing rare disease terminologies.
- Modular Structure: Comprises essential data elements categorized into formal 
    criteria, personal information, patient status, disease, genetic findings, 
    phenotypic findings, and family history.
- Cross-registry Compatibility: Enables data reuse across multiple registries 
    with consistent encoding and semantic alignment.

## Getting Started

This section provides instructions for getting started with the RD-CDM. For more
detail please read our [Documentation](https://rd-cdm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies in requirements.txt

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/BIH-CEI/rd-cdm.git
  cd rd-cdm
  ```

2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Run tests to validate the JSON schema:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/
  ```

## Contributing and Contact

The RD-CDM is a community-driven effort and we invite open and international
collaboration. Please feel free to create issues, discuss features, 
or submit pull requests to help enhance this project. For larger contributions, 
consider reaching out to discuss collaboration opportunities. 
Please find more information on how to contact us and contribute 
in the [`Contribution` section of our documentation](https://rd-cdm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html).

## RareLink 

RareLink is a novel rare disease framework in REDCap linking international 
registries, FHIR, and Phenopackets based on the RD-CDM. It is designed to 
support the collection of harmonized data for rare disease research 
across any REDCap project worldwide and allows for the preconfigured export of 
the RD-CDM data in FHIR and Phenopackets formats.
