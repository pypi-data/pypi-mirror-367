    File or stream can describe :py:class:`tradingstrategy.candle.Candle`

    Filtering of candle data can be done
    during the read time, so that large dataset files do not need
    to be fully loaded to the memory. This severely reduces
    the RAM usage for low-memory environments when dealing Parquet.

    `For filtering options see Parquet documentation <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.parquet.read_table.html>`_.

    See :py:func:`pyarrow.parquet.read_table`.

    You can disable "threaded read" using ``PYARROW_THREADED_READ``
    environment variable to lower the memory consumption.
