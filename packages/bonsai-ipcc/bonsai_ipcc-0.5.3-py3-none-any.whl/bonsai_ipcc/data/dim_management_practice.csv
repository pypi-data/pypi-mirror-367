code,description
full-till,Substantial soil disturbance with full inversion and/or frequent (within year) tillage operations. At planting time little (e.g. <30%) of the surface is covered by residues.
reduced-till,Primary and/or secondary tillage but with reduced soil disturbance (usually shallow and without full soil inversion). Normally leaves surface with >30% coverage by residues at planting.
no-till,Direct seeding without primary tillage with only minimal soil disturbance in the seeding zone. Herbicides are typically used for weed control.
unimproved_grasland,Represents non-degraded and sustainably managed grassland but without significant management improvements.
mod-degraded_grasland,Represents overgrazed or moderately degraded grassland with somewhat reduced productivity (relative to the native or nominally managed grassland) and receiving no management inputs.
high-degraded_grasland,Implies major long-term loss of productivity and vegetation cover due to severe mechanical damage to the vegetation and/or severe soil erosion.
improved_grasland,Represents grassland which is sustainably managed with moderate grazing pressure and that receive at least one improvement (e.g. fertilization - species improvement - irrigation).
