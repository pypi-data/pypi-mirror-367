code,description
HAC,Soils with high activity clay (HAC) minerals are lightly to moderately weathered soils which are dominated by 2:1 silicate clay. (in the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) classification these include Leptosols - Vertisols - Kastanozems - Chernozems - Phaeozems - Luvisols - Alisols - Albeluvisols - Solonetz - Calcisols - Gypsisols - Umbrisols - Cambisols - Regosols. In USDA classification includes Mollisols - Vertisols - high-base status Alfisols - Aridisols - Inceptisols).
LAC,Soils with low activity clay (LAC) minerals are highly weathered soils dominated by 1:1 clay minerals and amorphous iron and aluminium oxides (in WRB classification includes Acrisols - Lixisols - Nitisols - Ferralsols - Durisols. In USDA classification includes Ultisols - Oxisols - acidic Alfisols).
sandy,Includes all soils (regardless of taxonomic classification) having > 70% sand and < 8% clay based on standard textural analyses (in WRB classification includes Arenosols. in USDA classification includes Psamments).
spodic,Soils exhibiting strong podzolization (in WRB classification includes Podzols. In USDA classification Spodosols)
volcanic,Soils derived from volcanic ash with allophanic mineralogy (in WRB classification Andosols. in USDA classification Andisols)
wetland,Soils with restricted drainage leading to periodic flooding and anaerobic conditions (in WRB classification Gleysols. in USDA classification Aquic suborders).
organic,Soils with thickness of organic horizon greater than or equal to 10 cm. A horizon of less than 20 cm must have 12 percent or more organic carbon when mixed to a depth of 20 cm.
