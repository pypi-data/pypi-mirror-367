code,description
low,Low residue return occurs when there isremoval of residues (via collection or burning) - frequent bare-fallowing - production of crops yielding low residues (e.g. vegetables - tobacco - cotton)  no mineral fertilization or N-fixing crops
medium,Representative for annual cropping with cereals where all crop residues are returned to the field. If residues are removed then supplemental organic matter (e.g. manure) is added. Also requires mineral fertilization or N-fixing crop in rotation.
high_no_manure,Represents significantly greater crop residue inputs over medium C input cropping systems due to additional practices - such as production of high residue yielding crops - use of green manures - cover crops - improved vegetated fallows - irrigation - frequent use of perennial grasses in annual crop rotations - but without manure applied (see row below).
high_with_manure,Represents significantly higher C input over medium C input cropping systems due to an additional practice of regular addition of animal manure.
medium_improved_gl,Applies to improved grassland where no additional management inputs have been used
high_improved_gl,Applies to improved grassland where one or more additional management inputs/improvements have been used (beyond that is required to be classified as improved grassland).
