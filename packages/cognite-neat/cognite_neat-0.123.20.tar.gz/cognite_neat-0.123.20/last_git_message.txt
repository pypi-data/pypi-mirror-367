Object oriented NeatSession: Data Model - READ APIs (#1260)

# Description

Object oriented NeatSession endpoint for reading of data models. Now
users can read data models into neat session using the following
approach:

```
neat.data_model.read(...)
```

making this more convenient way of interacting with neat, as well
external data model reader plugins.

To risk-reviewers: this is part of refactoring of neat session endpoints
which will be followed by a soft migration of users. Current endpoints
in NeatSession are more "function based". Initially this approach worked
very well, however, a need for "object oriented" design of endpoints
emerged over time. This refactoring of endpoints are critical to provide
an easy access to external plugins as well.

**Risk reviewing**: This PR does not bring any new functionalities.
Methods already exist but are accessible via functional approach in
interaction with NeatSession. They are copied to be "object oriented"
accessible.

**Large number of lines is due to (regression) test data!**
