# üíª macOS Deploy

## üö© Architecture related

Check the architecture with the following command (generally `x86_64` for Intel chips and `arm64` for Apple chips)  

```bash
python -c "import platform; print(platform.machine())"
```

1. `x86_64` architecture: The developer virtual machine is generally this architecture, and you can follow the process below  
2. `arm64` architecture: CGS-init.app will automatically install `Rosetta 2`, and some [solutions to the error message](#trying-for-pop-up-error-messages) are listed below

## Portable Package

macOS only needs to download the `CGS-macOS` compressed package

### Trying for pop-up error messages

```bash
# arm64 CGS.app shows corrupted and cannot be opened
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 /Applications/CGS.app/Contents/Resources/scripts/CGS.py
# or
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 /Applications/CGS.app/Contents/Resources/scripts/CGS.py
```

::: info If both fail, you can try to find methods by chatgpt / feedback in the group
:::

### Updating

‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration files / deduplication records are stored in `scripts`, please be careful not to lose them by directly overwriting when downloading packages
If there are UI/Interface changes, it is recommended to run `CGS-init.app` to ensure that the font settings are correct

### Bug report / submit issue

When running software on macOS and encountering errors that need to be reported as issues, in addition to selecting `macOS` in the system, 
you also need to specify the system version and architecture in the description  
(Developer development environment is `macOS Sonoma(14) / x86_64`)
