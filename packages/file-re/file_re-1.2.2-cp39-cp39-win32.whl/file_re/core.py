        Search the first occurrence of the regex in the file.

        Args:
            regex (str): The regular expression pattern to search for. This should be
                a valid regex pattern supported by the `re` module.
            file_path (Union[str, Path]): The path to the file, provided as either a
                string or a Path object. The file will be read, and the regex applied
                to its content.
            multiline (bool, optional): If True, allows the regex to match across
                multiple lines by loading the entire file into memory. Defaults to False.
            num_lines (int, optional): If provided, uses a sliding window approach
                with the specified number of lines to match patterns across multiple
                lines without loading the entire file into memory. Cannot be used
