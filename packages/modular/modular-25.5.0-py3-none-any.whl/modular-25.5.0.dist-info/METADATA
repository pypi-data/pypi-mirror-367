# Modular

The Modular Platform is an open and fully-integrated suite of AI libraries and
tools that accelerates model serving and scales GenAI deployments. It abstracts
away hardware complexity so you can run the most popular open AI models with
industry-leading performance on GPUs and CPUs. You can also customize
everything from the serving pipeline and model architecture all the way down to
the metal by writing custom ops and GPU kernels in Mojo. [Read

## Get started

It takes only a moment to start an OpenAI-compatible endpoint or use our Python
API to run inference with a GenAI model from Hugging Face.

Try it now with our [quickstart guide](https://docs.modular.com/max/get-started).
