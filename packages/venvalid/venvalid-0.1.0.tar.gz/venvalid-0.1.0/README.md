## About

**Venvalid** is a minimalist and developer-friendly environment variable validator for Python — inspired by the simplicity and clarity of [`envalid`](https://github.com/af/envalid) from the Node.js world.

It lets you define a schema for your environment variables and ensures they are present, well-formed, and ready to use — before your app even starts.
