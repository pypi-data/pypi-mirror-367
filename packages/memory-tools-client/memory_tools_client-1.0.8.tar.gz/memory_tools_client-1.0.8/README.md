# 🐍 Memory Tools Python Client

An asynchronous Python 3 client for the **Memory Tools** database. It uses `asyncio` and `ssl` for efficient and secure communication over TLS.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Secure by Default:** Establishes encrypted TLS connections to the Memory Tools server.
- **Robust & Resilient:** Features automatic reconnection logic to handle intermittent network issues.
- **Fully Asynchronous:** Built on `asyncio` for high-performance, non-blocking operations.
- **Client-Focused API:** Supports all operations available to a standard remote client, including collections, items, indexes, and complex queries.
- **Pythonic Interface:** Can be used as an async context manager (`async with`) for easy and reliable connection handling.

---

## 🚀 Installation

_Currently, you need to install it directly from the source file._ (Eventualmente, podrías publicarlo en PyPI).

To run the tests after cloning the repository:

```bash
# First, ensure the server is running in a separate terminal
# go run .

# Then, run the test script
python3 test.py
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

### Basic Example with Context Manager (Recommended)

Using `async with` is the best practice as it automatically handles connecting and closing the client.

```python
import asyncio
from memory_tools_client import MemoryToolsClient

async def main():
    # The client will be automatically connected and closed
    try:
        # Connect as a standard user, e.g., 'admin'
        async with MemoryToolsClient("127.0.0.1", 5876, "admin", "adminpass", None, False) as client:
            print(f"Connected as '{client.authenticated_user}'")

            coll_name = "my_first_collection"
            await client.collection_create(coll_name)
            print(f"✔ Collection '{coll_name}' created.")

            # Set an item in the collection
            item_key = "user:101"
            item_value = {"name": "Alice", "status": "active", "level": 99}
            await client.collection_item_set(coll_name, item_key, item_value)
            print(f"✔ Item '{item_key}' set in collection.")

            # Get the item back
            result = await client.collection_item_get(coll_name, item_key)
            if result.found:
                print(f"✔ Item retrieved: {result.value}")

            # Clean up
            await client.collection_delete(coll_name)
            print(f"✔ Collection '{coll_name}' deleted.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✖ An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🔬 Advanced Queries with the `Query` Object

The `Query` class is the most powerful feature of the client, allowing you to build complex, server-side queries. This is highly efficient as it avoids transferring entire collections over the network.

### Query Parameters

You create a `Query` object by passing keyword arguments:

- `filter` (dict): Defines conditions to select items (like a `WHERE` clause).
- `order_by` (list): Sorts the results based on one or more fields.
- `limit` (int): Restricts the maximum number of results returned.
- `offset` (int): Skips a specified number of results, used for pagination.
- `count` (bool): If `True`, returns a count of matching items instead of the items themselves.
- `distinct` (str): Returns a list of unique values for the specified field.
- `group_by` (list): Groups results by one or more fields to perform aggregations.
- `aggregations` (dict): Defines aggregation functions to run on groups (e.g., `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`).
- `having` (dict): Filters the results _after_ grouping and aggregation (like a `HAVING` clause).

### Building Filters

The `filter` dictionary is the core of your query. It can be a single condition or a nested structure using logical operators.

**Single Condition Structure:** `{"field": "field_name", "op": "operator", "value": ...}`

| Operator (`op`) | Description                                         | Example `value`            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `=`             | Equal to                                            | `"some_string"` or `123`   |
| `!=`            | Not equal to                                        | `"some_string"` or `123`   |
| `>`             | Greater than                                        | `100`                      |
| `>=`            | Greater than or equal to                            | `100`                      |
| `<`             | Less than                                           | `50`                       |
| `<=`            | Less than or equal to                               | `50`                       |
| `like`          | Case-insensitive pattern matching (`%` is wildcard) | `"start%"` or `"%middle%"` |
| `in`            | Value is in a list of possibilities                 | `["value1", "value2"]`     |
| `between`       | Value is between two values (inclusive)             | `[10, 20]`                 |
| `is null`       | The field does not exist or is `null`               | `True` (o cualquier valor) |
| `is not null`   | The field exists and is not `null`                  | `True` (o cualquier valor) |

**Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`):**

You can combine conditions into complex logic.

```python
# Query: Find users who are active AND (live in Madrid OR live in Barcelona)
query = Query(filter={
    "and": [
        {"field": "active", "op": "=", "value": True},
        {"or": [
            {"field": "city", "op": "=", "value": "Madrid"},
            {"field": "city", "op": "=", "value": "Barcelona"}
        ]}
    ]
})
```

### Aggregation Example

You can perform powerful data analysis directly on the server.

```python
# Query: Count the number of active users per city and calculate the average score,
# but only for cities having more than 10 active users.

query = Query(
    # First, select only active users
    filter={"field": "active", "op": "=", "value": True},

    # Group by the 'city' field
    group_by=["city"],

    # Define aggregations to perform on each group
    aggregations={
        "user_count": {"func": "count", "field": "_id"},
        "average_score": {"func": "avg", "field": "score"}
    },

    # Filter the groups after aggregation
    having={"field": "user_count", "op": ">", "value": 10},

    # Order the final results
    order_by=[{"field": "average_score", "direction": "desc"}]
)

# results = await client.collection_query("users", query)
# print(json.dumps(results, indent=2))
```

## ⚡ API Reference

### Connection and Session

#### `MemoryToolsClient(host, port, username?, password?, server_cert_path?, reject_unauthorized?)`

Returns a list of all collection names the user has access to.

### Index Operations

#### `async collection_index_create(collection_name: str, field_name: str) -> CommandResponse`

Executes a complex query on a collection.

- **`query`** (`Query`): A `Query` object defining the operation. See the "Advanced Queries" section for details.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Use TLS:** Always connect over TLS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Verify Certificates:** In production, always set `reject_unauthorized=True` (the default) and provide a `server_cert_path` to your CA certificate. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Manage Credentials:** Avoid hardcoding credentials. Use environment variables or a secrets management system.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Create users with the minimum permissions they need. Avoid using the `admin` user for regular application access.
