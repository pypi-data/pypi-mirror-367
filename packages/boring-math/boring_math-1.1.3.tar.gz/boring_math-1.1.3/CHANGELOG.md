# CHANGELOG

PyPI Boring Math special functions project.

## Semantic Versioning

Strict 3 digit semantic versioning.

- **MAJOR** version incremented for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version incremented for backward compatible added functionality
- **PATCH** version incremented for backward compatible bug fixes

See [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org).

## Releases and other important milestones

### Version 1.1.3 - PyPI release date 2025-08-04

Created a second changelog, this one in Markdown, for the special
functions effort. So far it is just an `__init__.py` file with
documentation for things I have not yet written.

### Version 1.1.0 - PyPI release date 2025-08-03

Decided to create a special functions project and put it in the base
boring-math repo. Its version number will mirror, if not drive, the
version number for the overall Boring Math effort.
