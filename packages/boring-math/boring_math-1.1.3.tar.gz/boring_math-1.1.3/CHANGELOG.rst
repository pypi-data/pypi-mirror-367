CHANGELOG
+++++++++

Daddy's boring math library
---------------------------

Mathematical hobby projects. Done under the PyPI boring-math namespace.

The name of this library was suggested by my then 13 year old daughter
Mary.

Important Milestones
--------------------

2025-08-04 - PyPI Boring Math release v1.1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I created a separate CHANGELOG for the ``boring_math.special_functions``
package. It is in Markdown format. The entire Boring Math effort and
the special functions package will share the same version number.

I am adopting what I did for for my Pythonic Functional Programming
namespace (pythonic-fp) projects. I will keep the information I maintain
in README files to a minimum and driver Sphinx based documentation based
on the content of docstrings. 

2025-08-04 - PyPI releases boring-math & boring-math-integer-math
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Released boring-math v1.1.2 & boring-math-integer-math v0.8.1. Using these
two to iron out the release process. Still need to bootstrap Sphinx
documentation. As I correct problems with these, I update the rest of
the boring math repos.

2025-07-30 - changing namespace to boring-math
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The boring-math name is not claimed on PyPI. I set up a stub project
under that name like I did with pythonic-fp. I will also move the
recursive-functions project to it. The other 3 will have to wait until
I deploy the next parallel release of my pythonic-fp PyPI projects.

2025-07-14 - pythonic-fp migration complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Migration complete, all dtools PyPI projects and corresponding GitHub
repos have been archived. 

Latest PyPI Releases for

- bm.integer-math v0.7.1
- bm.probability-distributions v0.7.1
- bm.pythagorean-triples v0.6.1
- bm.recursive-functions v0.6.1

Also got rid of links to the old grscheller.bm documentation.

2025-07-13 - pythonic-fp migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Migrating dependencies from dtools to pythonic-fp PyPI namespace. Once
completed, I plan to archive my PyPI and GitHub dtools namespace repos.

2025-04-22 - Renamed repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project is a collection of PyPI namespace projects all under the ``bm``
namespace name. Did not realize at the time that the ``bm`` name was already
taken on PyPI.

- renamed `grscheller/boring-math-docs` GitHub repo to `grscheller/bm-docs` 
- created this CHANGELOG.md file
- is not associated with

  - either the `https://pypi.org/project/bm` PyPI project
  - or the `https://github.com/cym13/bookmark` GitHub repo
