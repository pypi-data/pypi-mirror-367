**A framework for optimizing DSPy programs with RL.**

[![PyPI Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/arbor-ai/month)](https://pepy.tech/projects/arbor-ai)

---

## üöÄ Installation

Install Arbor via pip:

```bash
pip install -U arbor-ai
```

Optionally, you can also install flash attention to speed up inference. <br/>
This can take 15+ minutes to install on some setups:

```bash
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Server

**CLI:**

```bash
python -m arbor.cli serve
```

On the first run you'll be asked which GPUs will be used for training and which for inference. For more that one GPU, separate the ids by comma: `1, 2`. Your config file will be saved in `~/.arbor/config.yaml` should you want to edit these configs in the future.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize a DSPy Program

Follow the DSPy tutorials here to see usage examples:
[DSPy RL Optimization Examples](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/rl_papillon/)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor your GPU usage

```bash
python -m arbor.server.monitor.cli
```

---

### Troubleshooting

**NCCL Errors**
Certain GPU setups, particularly with newer GPUs, seem to have issues with NCCL that cause Arbor to crash. Often times of these can be fixed with the following environment variables:

```bash
export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1
export NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1
```

**NVCC**
If you run into issues, double check that you have [nvcc](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/) installed:

```bash
nvcc --version
```

If you don't have admin permissions, you can often install nvcc using conda.
