## 🔎 Aiology-Similarity

Aiology-Similarity is a package which pressents you Similarity module to determine how similar two things are ,such as text ,and images

## 💡 Tip

This module doesn't need any AI token to work ,and it is an offline module which works based on its algorithms ,and it includes two algorithms :

### Image detection algorithm

I called this algorithm IMA-SAME-ALGORITHM 😁 which I wrote based on my math knowledge ,This algorithm designed to be as fast as possible ,and detect all similarity also in images pixels !!

### Text detection algorithm

I called this algorithm WORD-SAME-ALGORITHM 😁 which I wrote based on my math knowledge ,This algorithm designed to be as fast as possible ,and detect all similarity also in a word letters !!
