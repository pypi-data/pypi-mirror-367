# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.12.1 - 2025-08-05

### Fixed

- The `<object>` element's name was changed to `object_` to avoid collisions
with the builtin `object()` function. There was also a name conflict with the
`type` attribute, so that was renamed to `type_`.
- Add missing `type_` attribute to the `<button>` element and fix broken links
in the attribute documentation.

### Changed

- The base `Element` and `VoidElement` classes should return `Self`.

## 0.12.0 - 2025-07-08

### Added

- Add support for remaining elements that the library should support.
([#13](https://todo.sr.ht/~loges/haitch/13))

### Fixed

- The `name` and `type` attributes for `input` elements are not required.
- Make `alt` attribute for `img` elements not required according to HTML spec.

## 0.11.0 - 2025-07-03

### Deprecated

- The `html5` component will not be shipped in the v1 release. It's too
opinionated to be a part of the library. It will, however, be documented in the
future documentation as an example of how one could define a page component.

### Changed

- URLs in an element's attribute definition now link to the attributes section
in on the respective page, not the top of the page.
- Documentation sweep on all supported elements: cap column width at 80, drop
filler words, and fix typos.

### Fixed

- The `script` element must be marked as unsafe. Otherwise, the JavaScript will
  not be able to run properly.
- The `default` attribute for `<track>` elements is a boolean, not string.
