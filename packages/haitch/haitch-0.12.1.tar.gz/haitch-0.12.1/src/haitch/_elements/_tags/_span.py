    Span does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group
    elements for styling purposes (using the `class` or `id` attributes), or
    because they share attribute values, such as `lang`. It should be used only
    when no other semantic element is appropriate. `<span>` is very much like a
    `<div>` element, but `<div>` is a block-level element whereas a `<span>` is
    an inline-level element.
