TanaT Documentation
===================

*TanaT* is an extensible Python library for temporal sequence analysis with a primary focus on patient care pathways.

The objective of this library is to gather a collection of tools related to the analysis of timed sequences (or trajectories). 
It has been strongly inspired by the `TraMineR <http://traminer.unige.ch/>`_ library for the analysis of state sequences in R 
and libraries dedicated to time series analysis such as `aeon <https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/>`_ or `tslearn <https://tslearn.readthedocs.io/>`_.

The originality of *TanaT* is to support multi-sequence trajectories that can combine three types of temporal data: states, intervals, and events.
This allows tracking subjects (patients, users, customers, etc.) over time across multiple dimensions, providing a richer and more complete view of their temporal evolution.
The library provides a comprehensive toolkit for multidimensional temporal pattern discovery and analysis.
