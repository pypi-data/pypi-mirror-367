# RIVeR: Rectification of Image Velocity Results

**RIVeR** (Rectification of Image Velocity Results) is a modern, open-source toolkit for Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (**LSPIV**) distributed by [ORUS](https://orus.cam). Built with **Python** and **React**, it provides a user-friendly interface for water-surface velocity analysis and flow discharge measurements in rivers and large-scale hydraulic models.

## 💧 Overview
RIVeR is a specialized tool for applying Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) techniques as a non-contact method to estimate discharge in rivers and channels from video footage. The software guides the process through intuitive defaults and pre-configured settings, enabling users to generate discharge calculations without extensive prior knowledge of the technique. The workflow guides users through a series of straightforward steps culminating in comprehensive visual reports.

Originally developed in MATLAB in 2015 and well-received by the hydrology community, RIVeR has now been reimplemented in Python and JavaScript to improve accessibility, performance, and cross-platform compatibility.

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Installation & Usage

For those who prefer to work with the source code or contribute to RIVeR's development, here's how to get started:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- pip package manager
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Development Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oruscam/RIVeR.git
cd RIVeR
pip install -e .
```
### CLI Installation
RIVeR CLI provides a comprehensive set of commands for performing LSPIV analysis through the command line.

```bash
pip install river-cli
```
#### Basic Usage
```bash
river-cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```
To see all available commands and options:
```bash
river-cli --help
```
#### Example Workflow
```bash
# 1. Extract frames from video
river-cli video-to-frames river_video.mp4 ./frames --every 2

# 2. Generate transformation matrix
river-cli get-uav-transformation-matrix 100 200 300 400 0 0 10 10 --image-path ./frames/frame_001.jpg

# 3. Create masks for PIV analysis
river-cli create-mask-and-bbox 3 ./frames/frame_001.jpg ./xsections.json ./transformation_matrix.json --save-png-mask

# 4. Run PIV analysis
river-cli piv-analyze ./frames --mask ./mask.json --workdir ./results

# 5. Calculate discharge
river-cli update-xsection ./xsections.json ./results/piv_results.json ./transformation_matrix.json --step 2 --fps 30 --id-section 0
```

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

RIVeR also provides a user-friendly graphical interface built with React. The GUI offers an intuitive way to perform LSPIV analysis without using command-line tools.

Key GUI features include:
- Interactive workflow interface
- Visual cross-section creation
- Real-time PIV analysis visualization
- Result export capabilities

For detailed information about installation, usage, and features of the GUI, please see the dedicated [GUI documentation](gui/README.md).
