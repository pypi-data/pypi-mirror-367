ùìü ùì® ùì§ ùì£ stands for Python UML Tool. This is the second version the external data model for Pyut
that allows for external plugin development.  This version relies on Python's data classes, thus 
removing lots of boilerplate code as well as "java" idiom code.

I am concerned about GitHub's Copilot project


I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org).

While I do not advocate for all the issues listed there I do not like that a company like Microsoft may profit from open source projects.

I continue to use GitHub because it offers the services I need for free.  But, I continue to monitor their terms of service.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's code in Copilot.
