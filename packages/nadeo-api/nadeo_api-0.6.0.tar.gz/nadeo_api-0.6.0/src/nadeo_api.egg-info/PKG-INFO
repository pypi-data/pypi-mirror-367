A library to assist with accessing Nadeo's web services API and the public Trackmania API (OAuth2).

The web services API has community-driven documentation [here](https://webservices.openplanet.dev/).\
The main section of this API (named "Core") has an up-to-date list of valid endpoints being kept [here](https://github.com/openplanet-nl/core-api-tracking).\
Most of these endpoints are not documented at all, but you may help supplement the documentation [here](https://github.com/openplanet-nl/nadeoapi-docs).

The public Trackmania API has official documentation [here](https://api.trackmania.com/doc).\
There is also community-driven documentation [here](https://webservices.openplanet.dev/oauth/reference) which should be a bit more useful.

Installing the package from PyPI:
```
python -m pip install nadeo-api
```

Using the package:
```py
import nadeo_api        # main module - various things
import nadeo_api.auth   # authentication - required for any endpoint
import nadeo_api.core   # web services Core endpoints
import nadeo_api.live   # web services Live endpoints
import nadeo_api.meet   # web services Meet endpoints
import nadeo_api.oauth  # OAuth2 endpoints (public API)
import nadeo_api.state  # unnecessary - use the main module instead
import nadeo_api.util   # unnecessary - use the main module instead
```

There are also some options you can configure:
```py
nadeo_api.debug_logging = True            # enable debug logging
nadeo_api.wait_between_requests_ms = 500  # change self rate limiting
```
