    Weighted Least Squares Regression Model Function. Weights are calcualted as the inverse of the amplitude. 

    Parameters:
    - x: Independent variable(s), should be a 1D or 2D array-like structure.
    - y: Dependent variable, should be a 1D array-like structure.

    Returns:
    - slope: Slope coefficient(s) of the model.
    - intercept: Intercept of the model.
    - r_squared: Coefficient of determination.
    - p_value: p-value associated with the slope(s).
    - std_err: Standard error of the slope coefficient(s).
    - results: The results object from the regression model.
