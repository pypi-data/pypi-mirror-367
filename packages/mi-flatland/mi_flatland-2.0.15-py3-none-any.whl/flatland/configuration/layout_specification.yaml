# layout_specification.yaml â€“ Overall diagram layout parameters

- standard:  # Name of the system default diagram layout parameters
    # Diagram layout
    default margin:  # Distance from edge of diagram area to nearest drawn element on the diagram
      top: 10
      bottom: 10
      left: 10
      right: 10
    default diagram origin:  # Lower left corner of the diagram relative to the Canvas area
      x: 0  # This origin can be overriden by the user in the mls file with padding values
      y: 0
    # Grid/node layout
    default cell padding:  # Gaps between cell and node edges, forms a margin around a node within a cell
      top: 5
      bottom: 5
      left: 5
      right: 5
    default cell alignment:  # Node is aligned this way by default, user can override in mls file
      vertical: center
      horizontal: center
    # Connector layout

    # For a Stem that has no graphic decoration, such as an xUML class binary association connection or a xUML subclass
    # connection, this is the minimum distance from the node face to either a bend or the opposing Stem end. It prevents
    # a bend too close to a Node face or a connection too close to another Node.
    undecorated stem clearance: 11
    default cname positions: 5  # The number of connector name positions along a bend
    default stem positions: 5  # Number of positions wher a connector can anchor on a face of a node
    default rut positions: 5  # Number of positions a connector can follow within a row or column
    default new path row height: 100  # Minimum space required for a connector traveling outside the
    default new path col width: 150   #   furthest occupied row or column to bend around to its destination face
