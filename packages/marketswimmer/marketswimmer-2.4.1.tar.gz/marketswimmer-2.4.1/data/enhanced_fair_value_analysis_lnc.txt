KEY ADJUSTMENTS MADE:
1. Used insurance company methodology for Owner Earnings
2. Included Class B preferred shares as debt-like obligation
3. Updated cash/debt figures to latest quarter
4. Detailed scenario breakdown showing all components

INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
- Class B shares have 9% coupon, callable after 2027
- Insurance industry faces interest rate and regulatory pressures
- Significant gap between intrinsic value and market price suggests either:
  * Market inefficiency/undervaluation
  * Unrecognized risks or challenges
  * Industry-specific headwinds
