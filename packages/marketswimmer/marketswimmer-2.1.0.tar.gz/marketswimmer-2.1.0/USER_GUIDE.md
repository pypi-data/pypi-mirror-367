## 🎓 Understanding Owner Earnings

Owner Earnings represents the true cash a business generates for its owners. Here's what each component means:

- **Net Income**: Reported profit (but may include non-cash items)
- **+ Depreciation**: Add back non-cash expense  
- **- CapEx**: Subtract money spent on equipment/buildings
- **- Working Capital Changes**: Subtract money tied up in operations

**The result** is actual cash available to owners, which is what Warren Buffett focuses on when evaluating investments.

## 🔄 Regular Updates

MarketSwimmer downloads fresh financial data each time you analyze a ticker. For the most current analysis:

```bash
# Force fresh download (recommended monthly)
ms analyze TICKER --force

# Quick refresh (uses cached data if recent)
ms analyze TICKER
```

## 💬 Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Run `ms status` to verify installation
- [ ] Try `ms quick-start` for interactive guide
- [ ] Analyze a familiar company: `ms analyze AAPL`
- [ ] Check the generated files in `data/` and `charts/`
- [ ] Launch GUI for easy exploration: `ms gui`
- [ ] Bookmark this guide for reference

## 🏆 Pro Tips

1. **Start with large, established companies** (AAPL, MSFT, BRK.B) - they have cleaner data
2. **Use the GUI first** to understand the workflow, then graduate to CLI for speed
3. **Check the charts folder** - the visualizations tell the story better than raw numbers
4. **Run monthly updates** with `--force` flag to get fresh data
5. **Use `ms examples`** when you forget command syntax
