**Scaling data analyses in cellular cryoET using comprehensive segmentation.**  

## Abstract

Automation and improved hardware have greatly accelerated the rate of data generation in cryoET. As the field moves towards quantitative cryoET, the scale of the resulting datasets presents a significant challenge for analysis and interpretation. To explore ways of handling datasets comprising thousands of tomograms, we investigated a comprehensive segmentation strategy – assigning an ontology-based identity to every voxel in a dataset – that is based on the sequential application of multiple convolutional neural networks. Using an openly available [dataset](https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com/datasets/10302) of over 1800 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii tomograms as a test case, we demonstrate the segmentation of 25 different subcellular features across the full dataset, while requiring only a few seconds of processing time per tomogram. We show how the approach enables the representation of large datasets as searchable databases and propose the usage of ontology-based segmentations for improving two common processing tasks in cryoET. First, we explore context-aware particle picking as a method to retain biological context when selecting particles for subtomogram averaging and other downstream analyses. Secondly, we demonstrate area-selective template matching, where we use segmentation-based masks to avoid redundant computations in template matching and enable >500-fold faster processing in specific cases. To illustrate the utility of the approach, all segmentation results have also been made available online via cryopom.streamlit.app.
