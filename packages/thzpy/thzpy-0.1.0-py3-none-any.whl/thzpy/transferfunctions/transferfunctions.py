    """Transfer function for a slab of a single medium.

    Calculates the optical constants of a sample composed of a single medium
    from the time-domain waveforms of the sample and the instrument baseline.
    Waveforms are tranformed into the frequency domain using the discrete
    Fourier transform, and the transmission amplitude and phase are computed
    from the DFT output. An infomed phase unwrapping procedure is used
    here to prevent overcorrection of the phase. A transfer function is then
    applied to calculate refractive index and absorption coefficient from the
    phase and amplitude data. These are then used to determine other relevant
    optical constants.

    Calculates the optical constants of a sample comprising a slab of a
    well-mixed binary mixture. The sample measurement should be of the mixed
    sample, while the reference measurement should be of one component of the
    misture in isolation.

    Waveforms are tranformed into the frequency

    then the transfer function for a uniform slab performed for the both the
    sample and reference with respect to baseline. Effective medium theory is
    then used to extract the optical constants of the intrinsic material.

    If only sample and reference waveforms are provided then the refractive
    index of the reference is required as an additional parameter, and a
    different approximate transfer function is used for the sample with respect
    to the reference. Effective medium theory is then used to extract the
