# Upload Code Support for Flow Dev

## Executive Decision
**YES, add upload_code support with smart defaults.**

## Why (The 10x Improvement)
Current workflow:
1. Edit code locally
2. SSH and copy file
3. Run command
4. Repeat

New workflow:
1. Edit code locally  
2. `flow dev -c 'python script.py'` (auto-uploads)
3. Repeat

**This is a 3-10x improvement in iteration speed.**

## Design Principles Applied

### Larry Page Lens
- 10x not 10%: Remove friction from the development loop
- Measure: Track upload time, cache hits, developer velocity
- Platform thinking: This enables building AI/ML experiments faster

### Jeff Dean/Sanjay Lens  
- Clean abstraction: Working directory syncs transparently
- Efficient: Only upload changed files (use rsync algorithm)
- Cache-aware: Remember what's been uploaded

### Steve Jobs Lens
- "It just works": Developer's code is magically there
- No configuration needed for common case
- Progressive disclosure: Advanced options hidden

### Carmack Lens
- Optimize the critical path: Edit â†’ Run
- Every millisecond counts in the iteration loop
- Predictable behavior

## Implementation Design

```python
@click.option("--upload/--no-upload", default=True, 
              help="Auto-upload current directory (default: upload)")
@click.option("--upload-path", default=".", 
              help="Path to upload (default: current dir)")
@click.option("--exclude", multiple=True,
              help="Patterns to exclude from upload") 
```

### Smart Defaults
- **Default ON**: Optimizes for 90% use case (local development)
- **Smart excludes**: .git/, __pycache__/, *.pyc, node_modules/
- **Incremental**: Only upload changes since last sync
- **Fast path**: If no changes, skip upload entirely

### Implementation Approach
1. Use existing upload_code infrastructure from flow run
2. Add state tracking: ~/.flow/dev-sync/{vm-id}/manifest.json
3. Use checksums to detect changes
4. Background upload while VM starts (parallel)

## Why Default ON?

The 80/20 rule says 80% of developers:
- Edit in local IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc)
- Want their code on the GPU instance
- Don't want to think about file transfer

The 20% who SSH directly can use `--no-upload`.

## What Our Council Would Say

**Jobs**: "Why would anyone NOT want their code uploaded?"
**Dean**: "Make the common case fast"  
**Carmack**: "Remove every possible friction point"
**Page**: "This enables 10x faster ML experimentation"

## Alternative Considered: File Watching
Could do automatic sync on file change, but:
- More complex (YAGNI)
- Current design is simpler and sufficient
- Can add later if needed
