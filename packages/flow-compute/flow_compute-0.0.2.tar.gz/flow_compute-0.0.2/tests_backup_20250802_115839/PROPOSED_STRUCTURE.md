# Proposed Test Structure - Engineering Excellence

## Current Problems
- 10+ directories with unclear boundaries
- `functional/` vs `integration/` overlap
- Technical debt (`_fixed`, `_updated` files)
- Confusing categorization

## Proposed Structure (What the Masters Would Do)

```
tests/
├── fast/           # <1s, pure unit tests, mocked dependencies
├── slow/           # >1s, integration/e2e, real dependencies  
├── support/        # Everything else (fixtures, utils, scripts)
└── conftest.py     # Test configuration
```

### Alternative (Dependency-Based)

```
tests/
├── isolated/       # No external dependencies, pure logic
├── integrated/     # Multiple components, may use test services
├── system/         # Full system tests, real infrastructure
└── _support/       # Prefixed to sort last
```

## Key Principles

1. **Speed-Based Organization** (Google's Approach)
   - Fast tests run on every commit
   - Slow tests run on PR/nightly
   - Clear performance expectations

2. **Single Responsibility**
   - Each directory has ONE clear purpose
   - No overlap or confusion

3. **YAGNI Applied**
   - Only categories we actually need
   - Can add more later if truly needed

4. **Clean Code**
   - No `_fixed` or `_updated` variants
   - Version control tracks changes

## Migration Path

1. Analyze test execution times
2. Categorize by speed/dependencies
3. Bulk move with updated imports
4. Update CI pipeline
5. Delete empty directories

This structure would be ~70% simpler while maintaining all functionality.
