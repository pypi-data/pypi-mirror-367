"""Tests for FCP startup script size limits and compression behavior.

This module tests the boundary conditions around the 10KB FCP limit:
- Scripts under 10,000 characters should not be compressed
- Scripts exactly at 10,000 characters (edge case)
- Scripts over 10,000 characters should trigger compression

These tests ensure FCP compatibility as documented at:
https://docs.mlfoundry.com/compute-and-storage/startup-scripts
