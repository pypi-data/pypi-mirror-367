# Background

Long-standing AI research labs have invested to build sophisticated infrastructure abstractions that enable researchers to focus on research rather than DevOps. DeepMind's Xmanager handles experiments from single GPUs to hundreds of hosts. Meta's submitit brings Python-native patterns to cluster computing. OpenAI's internal platform was designed to seamlessly scale from interactive notebooks to thousand-GPU training runs.

Flow brings these same capabilities to every AI developer. Like these internal tools, Flow provides:
- **Progressive disclosure** - Simple tasks stay simple, complex workflows are possible
- **Unified abstraction** - One interface whether running locally or across heterogeneous cloud hardware  
- **Fail-fast validation** - Catch configuration errors before expensive compute starts
- **Experiment tracking** - Built-in task history

The goal: democratize the infrastructure abstractions that enable breakthrough AI research.
