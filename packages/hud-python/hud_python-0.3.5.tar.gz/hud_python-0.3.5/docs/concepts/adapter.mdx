# Adapter

An `Adapter` acts as a translator between the specific format used by an [Agent](/concepts/agent)'s underlying model (like Claude or OpenAI Computer Use) and the standardized formats used by the HUD [Environment](/concepts/environment).

## Overview

Different AI models might expect observations (like screenshots) in specific dimensions or return actions in unique structures. The `Adapter` handles these differences:

1.  **Observation Preprocessing:** It can resize or reformat environment observations (primarily screenshots) before they are sent to the agent via the `rescale()` method.
2.  **Action Postprocessing:** It converts the raw actions received from the agent's model into the standardized `CLA` (Command Language Action) format that the environment understands via the `adapt()` or `adapt_list()` methods. This includes mapping action names (e.g., mapping `key` to `press`) and rescaling coordinates from the agent's expected dimensions to the actual environment dimensions.

## Base Adapter Class (`hud.adapters.Adapter`)

The base `Adapter` class (`hud.adapters.common.adapter.Adapter`) defines the interface and common logic:

*   `__init__()`: Initializes default agent/environment dimensions (often overridden by subclasses).
*   `rescale(observation)`: Resizes an image observation (numpy array, PIL Image, or base64 string) to the `agent_width` and `agent_height` defined in the adapter. Returns the rescaled image as a base64 PNG string.
*   `convert(action)`: Abstract method (though often implemented in subclasses like `ClaudeAdapter` or `OperatorAdapter`) intended to translate a *single* raw action from the model into the `CLA` format. *Note: The main conversion logic usually happens within `adapt` or `adapt_list` in practice.* 
*   `postprocess_action(action_dict)`: Rescales coordinates within an action dictionary (already converted to a dict from CLA) from agent dimensions to environment dimensions.
*   `adapt(action)`: The primary method called by the base `Agent`'s `postprocess` stage. It typically calls `convert` to get a CLA object, then `json` to turn it into a dict, `postprocess_action` to rescale coordinates in the dict, and finally validates the rescaled dict back into a CLA object.
*   `adapt_list(actions)`: A helper method that applies `adapt` to each action in a list.

## Built-in Adapters

The SDK provides adapters for the built-in agents:

*   **`hud.adapters.claude.ClaudeAdapter`:** Translates actions from the format used by Anthropic's Claude Computer Use API into `CLA`. Handles coordinate scaling based on Claude's default dimensions (1024x768, unless overridden).
*   **`hud.adapters.operator.OperatorAdapter`:** Translates actions from the format used by OpenAI's Computer Use Preview API into `CLA`. Handles coordinate scaling based on OpenAI's default dimensions (1024x768, unless overridden).

## Using Adapters

Adapters are typically passed during the initialization of an `Agent`. If no adapter is provided to a built-in agent like `ClaudeAgent` or `OperatorAgent`, a default instance of the corresponding adapter (`ClaudeAdapter` or `OperatorAdapter`) is usually created internally.

```python
from hud.agent import OperatorAgent
from hud.adapters.operator import OperatorAdapter

# Create an adapter instance (optional, agent creates default if None)
# You might customize adapter parameters here if needed in the future
my_adapter = OperatorAdapter()

# Pass the adapter to the agent
agent = OperatorAgent(environment="browser", adapter=my_adapter)

# Now, when agent.predict() is called, it will use my_adapter
# for preprocessing (rescale) and postprocessing (adapt_list).
```

## Custom Adapters

If you create a custom agent that uses a unique action format or requires specific observation preprocessing, you can create a custom adapter by inheriting from `hud.adapters.Adapter` and implementing the necessary logic, primarily overriding the `convert` method or potentially `rescale` and `postprocess_action` if needed.

## Related Concepts

*   [Agent](/concepts/agent): Uses the Adapter to preprocess observations and postprocess actions.
*   [Environment](/concepts/environment): Consumes standardized `CLA` actions processed by the Adapter.
*   [Command Language Actions (CLA)](/api-reference/adapters): The standardized action format used by HUD environments.
