The `hud.trajectory` module provides classes for representing recorded environment interactions.

See the [Trajectory Concepts](/concepts/trajectory) page for explanations and usage examples, particularly how trajectories are accessed via `Job.load_trajectories()`.

# Classes

## Trajectory

```python
class Trajectory(pydantic.BaseModel):
    id: str
    reward: float | None = None
    logs: str | None = None
    error: str | None = None
    trajectory: list[TrajectoryStep] = []

    def display(self) -> None: ...
```

Represents the complete record of a single environment run, typically associated with a [Job](/concepts/job). Contains metadata about the run and a list of individual steps.

**Attributes:**

*   **`id` (str):** Unique identifier for this trajectory run.
*   **`reward` (float | None):** The final evaluation score returned by `env.evaluate()` for this run.
*   **`logs` (str | None):** Captured logs from the environment run.
*   **`error` (str | None):** Error message if the run terminated unexpectedly.
*   **`trajectory` (list[`TrajectoryStep`]):** A list containing the data for each step recorded during the run.

**Methods:**

*   **`display(self)`:** Renders a basic visualization of the trajectory steps within a Jupyter environment (attempts to display images and actions).

## TrajectoryStep

```python
class TrajectoryStep(pydantic.BaseModel):
    observation_url: str | None = None
    observation_text: str | None = None
    actions: list[dict]
    start_timestamp: str | None = None
    end_timestamp: str | None = None
```

Represents the data captured for a single step within a `Trajectory`.

**Attributes:**

*   **`observation_url` (str | None):** URL to the screenshot image captured as the observation for this step.
*   **`observation_text` (str | None):** Text captured as the observation for this step.
*   **`actions` (list[dict]):** List of action(s) (in dictionary format) that were executed by the agent *leading into* this step's observation.
*   **`start_timestamp` (str | None):** ISO format timestamp when the step started.
*   **`end_timestamp` (str | None):** ISO format timestamp when the step ended.
