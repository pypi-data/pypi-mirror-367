# Overview: Custom Environments

HUD empowers you to go beyond pre-defined environments like `hud-browser` by creating and using **Custom Environments**. These are Docker-based setups, giving you unparalleled control over the software stack, applications, and specific state needed for your agent evaluation scenarios.

Whether you're testing on your own web applications, complex desktop software, or unique backends, custom environments provide the flexibility and reproducibility required for robust agent evaluation.

## Why Use Custom Environments?

-   **Test Proprietary Systems**: Evaluate agents interacting with your internal web apps, desktop software (via VNC setups), or custom command-line tools within a controlled, containerized environment.
-   **Specialized Setups**: Create environments with specific operating system versions, pre-installed dependencies, databases, particular file structures, or unique network configurations that standard environments don't offer.
-   **Full Reproducibility**: Package your entire environment with Docker to ensure consistent testing conditions across different machines and over time.
-   **Complex Workflows**: Model tasks that involve multiple applications, system-level interactions, or require specific background services to be running.
-   **Community & Collaboration**: Share your specialized environments with the HUD community, or leverage environments contributed by others to expand your testing capabilities.

## Two Main Approaches to Custom Environments:

1.  **Containerized Web Applications (Accessed via `hud-browser`)**:
    *   **What it is**: You package your web application (e.g., a Flask/Django app, a static site, a Node.js service) into a Docker container.
    *   **How it works**: Define a `CustomGym` that points to this Docker image/build context. In your `Task`, you still specify `gym="hud-browser"`. HUD then runs your web app container and makes its exposed ports accessible to the `hud-browser` instance (typically via `http://localhost:PORT_FROM_YOUR_APP`). The agent interacts through the browser as usual.
    *   **Use Cases**: Testing your own web apps, staging environments, specific website versions.
    *   [See the Web App Testing Example &rarr;](/examples/web-app-testing)

2.  **Controller-Based Custom Environments (Full Control)**:
    *   **What it is**: You create a Docker image that includes a special Python package named `hud_controller`. This package contains your custom Python functions for `Task.setup` and `Task.evaluate` that run *inside* the Docker container.
    *   **How it works**: Define a `CustomGym` pointing to this Docker image/build context. In your `Task`, you set `gym=your_custom_gym_object`. The `setup` and `evaluate` functions in your task configuration will directly call the corresponding Python functions in your `hud_controller`.
    *   **Use Cases**: OS-level tasks, file system manipulation, testing desktop GUI applications (often with VNC and tools like `pyautogui` inside the controller), interacting with games, or any scenario requiring direct execution of Python logic within the controlled environment.
    *   [See the Custom OS Environment Example &rarr;](/examples/custom-os-env)

## Defining a `CustomGym`

Regardless of the approach, custom environments are specified using the `CustomGym` object:

```python
from hud.types import CustomGym
from pathlib import Path

# For a local Dockerfile build context (can be used for both approaches)
my_local_build_gym = CustomGym(
    location="local", 
    image_or_build_context=Path("./path/to/your/docker_env_folder")
)

# For a pre-built image from a registry (can be used for both approaches)
my_registry_image_gym = CustomGym(
    location="remote", # Or "local" if the image is available on your local Docker daemon
    image_or_build_context="your_username/your_custom_image:latest"
)
```

### Key `CustomGym` Parameters:

*   **`location` (`"local"` | `"remote"`):** Where the Docker container runs.
    *   `"local"`: Builds (if `image_or_build_context` is a Path) and runs on your machine. Requires Docker.
    *   `"remote"`: Runs on the HUD platform. If `image_or_build_context` is a Path, HUD will build it remotely. If it's an image name, HUD pulls it from a registry.
*   **`image_or_build_context` (str | `Path`):**
    *   `str`: A Docker image name (e.g., `"nginx:latest"`).
    *   `Path`: A local directory containing a `Dockerfile` (and for controller-based environments, a `hud_controller` package).
