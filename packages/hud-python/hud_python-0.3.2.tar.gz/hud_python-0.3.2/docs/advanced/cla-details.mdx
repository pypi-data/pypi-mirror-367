# Common Language Action (CLA) Details

The HUD SDK uses a standardized format called **CLA** (Common Language Actions) for representing agent interactions within an [Environment](/concepts/environment). When your [Agent](/concepts/agent) decides on an action (e.g., "click at x=100, y=200"), its associated [Adapter](/concepts/adapter) converts this into a specific `CLA` Pydantic model instance before it's sent to `env.step()`.

Understanding the structure of these `CLA` types can be helpful for debugging or creating custom adapters/controllers. The main types are defined in `hud.adapters.common.types`.

## Base Structure

All CLA actions inherit from `CLAAction` and have a `type` field which acts as a discriminator:

```python
class CLAAction(pydantic.BaseModel):
    type: str
```

## Action Categories & Examples

Here are some key CLA types grouped by category:

### Mouse Actions

*   **`ClickAction`**: Simulates mouse clicks.
    *   `point: Point | None`: Target coordinates (`Point(x: int, y: int)`).
    *   `button: Literal[...]`: `"left"`, `"right"`, `"wheel"`, `"back"`, `"forward"` (default: `"left"`).
    *   `pattern: list[int] | None`: List of delays (ms) for multi-clicks (e.g., `[100]` for double-click, `[100, 100]` for triple).
    *   `hold_keys: list[CLAKey] | None`: Modifier keys (e.g., `"shift"`, `"ctrl"`) to hold during the click.
    *   `selector: str | None`: Optional CSS selector to target instead of coordinates.

*   **`MoveAction`**: Moves the mouse cursor.
    *   `point: Point | None`: Target coordinates.
    *   `selector: str | None`: Optional CSS selector to move to.
    *   `offset: Point | None`: Offset relative to the target point/selector.

*   **`ScrollAction`**: Scrolls the view.
    *   `point: Point | None`: Coordinates *where* the scroll should originate (often ignored, scrolls the window).
    *   `scroll: Point | None`: Scroll amount `Point(x=dx, y=dy)`. Positive `dy` scrolls down, positive `dx` scrolls right.
    *   `hold_keys: list[CLAKey] | None`: Modifier keys to hold.

*   **`DragAction`**: Simulates clicking and dragging.
    *   `path: list[Point]`: A sequence of points defining the drag path (must have at least two points).
    *   `pattern: list[int] | None`: Optional delays between path segments.
    *   `hold_keys: list[CLAKey] | None`: Modifier keys to hold.

### Keyboard Actions

*   **`TypeAction`**: Types text.
    *   `text: str`: The text string to type.
    *   `selector: str | None`: Optional CSS selector to focus before typing.
    *   `enter_after: bool | None`: Whether to press Enter after typing (default: `False`).

*   **`PressAction`**: Presses and releases one or more keys simultaneously (hotkey).
    *   `keys: list[CLAKey]`: List of key names (`CLAKey` Literal type) to press together (e.g., `["ctrl", "c"]`).

*   **`KeyDownAction` / `KeyUpAction`**: Presses or releases keys without the corresponding up/down action. Useful for holding modifier keys.
    *   `keys: list[CLAKey]`: List of key names to press down or release up.

### Control Actions

*   **`WaitAction`**: Pauses execution.
    *   `time: int`: Duration to wait in milliseconds.

### Fetch Actions (Get Information)

*   **`ScreenshotFetch`**: Requests a screenshot (used internally, typically not sent by agents directly).
*   **`PositionFetch`**: Requests the current cursor position (used internally).

### Response Actions

*   **`ResponseAction`**: Used to submit a final text answer.
    *   `text: str`: The final textual response from the agent.

### Custom Actions

*   **`CustomAction`**: Allows defining arbitrary actions specific to a custom environment controller.
    *   `action: str`: The name/identifier of the custom action.
    *   *(Implicit)*: Any additional fields required by the custom action can be added if defined in the custom controller logic receiving it.

## `CLAKey` Type

The `CLAKey` is a `typing.Literal` containing dozens of standard key names, including:

*   Control Keys: `"backspace"`, `"tab"`, `"enter"`, `"shift"`, `"ctrl"`, `"alt"`, `"escape"`, `"space"`, `"pageup"`, `"pagedown"`, `"end"`, `"home"`, `"left"`, `"up"`, `"right"`, `"down"`, `"insert"`, `"delete"`.
*   Function Keys: `"f1"`, `"f2"`, ..., `"f24"`.
*   Numpad Keys: `"num0"`, `"num1"`, ..., `"add"`, `"multiply"`, etc.
*   Modifier Keys: `"win"`, `"command"`, `"option"`.
*   Printable Characters: `"a"`, `"b"`, `"1"`, `"!"`, `"#"` etc. (Note: For typing sentences, use `TypeAction`).

Refer to `hud/adapters/common/types.py` for the exhaustive list.

## Usage Context

Remember, an [Agent](/concepts/agent) typically outputs actions in its model's native format. The [Adapter](/concepts/adapter) converts these raw actions into one or more of these specific `CLA` Pydantic model instances, which are then passed in a list to `env.step()`.
