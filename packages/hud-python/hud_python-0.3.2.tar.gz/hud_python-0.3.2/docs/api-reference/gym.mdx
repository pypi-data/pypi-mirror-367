The `hud.gym` module provides the core function for creating [Environment](/concepts/environment) instances.

# Module Functions

## make

```python
async def make(
    env_src: Gym | Task,
    *,
    job: Job | None = None,
    metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
) -> Environment:
```

Creates and initializes an [Environment](/concepts/environment) instance based on a specification.

This function handles selecting the correct client (local docker, remote docker, remote direct) based on the `env_src`, automatically linking to an active [Job](/concepts/job) (from `@register_job` decorator or the `job` parameter), and running the initial [Task](/concepts/task) setup if `env_src` is a `Task`.

**Parameters:**

*   **`env_src` (`Gym` | `Task`):** The source specification for the environment.
    *   If a `str` (Gym ID like `"hud-browser"`, `"OSWorld-Ubuntu"`), creates a standard remote environment.
    *   If a `CustomGym` object, creates a custom environment based on its definition (local or remote docker).
    *   If a `Task` object, uses the `task.gym` attribute to determine the environment type and automatically runs `task.setup` after creation.
*   **`job` (`Job` | None, optional):** A specific [Job](/concepts/job) object to associate this environment run with. If `None`, it attempts to find an active job created by the `@register_job` decorator.
*   **`metadata` (dict[str, Any] | None, optional):** Additional metadata to attach to the environment instance and its resulting trajectory.

**Returns:**

*   `Environment`: An initialized environment instance ready for interaction (e.g., calling `env.step()`).
