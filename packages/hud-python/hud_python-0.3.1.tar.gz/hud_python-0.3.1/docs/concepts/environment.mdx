# Environment

An `Environment` in the HUD SDK represents the runtime instance (like a web browser or an operating system desktop) where an [Agent](/concepts/agent) interacts to complete a [Task](/concepts/task).

## Overview

The `Environment` is the core component your agent interacts with. It provides:

*   A way to send actions (like clicks, typing) in the standardized `CLA` format (see [Adapters](/concepts/adapter)) to the runtime.
*   A way to receive `Observation` objects (like screenshots, text) from the runtime.
*   Methods for managing the environment's lifecycle (`close`) and evaluating task success (`evaluate`).
*   Automatic recording of interactions into a [Trajectory](/concepts/trajectory) when linked to a [Job](/concepts/job).

## Creating an Environment

Environments are created using `hud.gym.make()`. You typically pass a [Task](/concepts/task) object, which defines the required environment type (`gym` attribute), setup actions, and evaluation logic.

```python
from hud import gym
from hud.task import Task

# Task defines the environment type (gym="hud-browser")
task = Task(
    prompt="Search Google for capybaras",
    gym="hud-browser",
    setup=("goto", "google.com")
)

# gym.make reads the task.gym attribute to create the right environment
# It also runs the task.setup actions internally.
env = await gym.make(task)

print("Browser environment created and setup complete.")
# await env.close()
```

You can also create environments directly using known Gym IDs:

```python
env_os = await gym.make("OSWorld-Ubuntu")
# await env_os.close()
```

Environments created this way won't have a default `Task` associated unless you explicitly reset them with one later using `env.reset()`. The `gym.make()` function also automatically links the environment to an active [Job](/concepts/job) if one was defined using the `@register_job` decorator.

## Available Environment Types

The HUD SDK provides several standard environment types, specified via the `gym` attribute in a [Task](/concepts/task) or directly in `hud.gym.make()`:

*   **`"hud-browser"`**: Provides a remote Chromium browser instance managed via Playwright. Ideal for web navigation, form interaction, and testing web applications.
    *   [See `hud-browser` Details](../environments/hud-browser.mdx)
*   **`"qa"`**: A non-interactive environment for question-answering tasks where the agent provides a direct textual response.
    *   [See `qa` Environment Details](../environments/qa.mdx)
*   **`CustomGym`**: Allows defining and running your own [Custom Environments](../advanced/custom-environments.mdx) using Docker, either locally or remotely. This provides maximum flexibility for specific testing needs.

The `gym` attribute in a Task tells `hud.gym.make()` which environment to instantiate.

## Interaction Loop

The standard interaction flow involves the [Agent](/concepts/agent) and the Environment:

1.  **Get Initial Observation:** Call `env.step()` *without actions* after `gym.make()`. This returns the starting `Observation`.
2.  **Agent Prediction:** Your agent's `predict(observation)` method processes the observation and decides on the next action(s).
3.  **Execute Action:** Call `env.step(actions)` with the agent's action(s) (which should be in `CLA` format, usually handled by an [Adapter](/concepts/adapter)). This executes the actions and returns the *next* `Observation`, `reward`, `terminated` flag, and `info` dict.
4.  **Repeat:** The agent continues predicting and stepping until the task is complete or the environment terminates.

```python
# Assume 'env' and 'agent' are initialized

# 1. Get initial observation
obs, _ = await env.reset()

# 4. Repeat loop (Agent predicts, Env steps)
for _ in range(10):
    # 2. Agent predicts action(s)
    actions, done = await agent.predict(obs)

    # 3. Execute action(s) in environment
    obs, reward, terminated, info = await env.step(actions)
    if done or terminated: break
```

*   **Note on QA Tasks:** For [Question-Answering Tasks](/concepts/task#defining-question-answering-qa-tasks), the agent might only need one `predict` call. The agent should output a `ResponseAction`, which the environment stores. The subsequent `env.evaluate()` call then checks this stored response. The environment itself remains largely passive for QA.

## Key Methods

*   **`env.step(actions: list[CLA] | None = None)`**: Executes actions (or gets initial state). Returns `(Observation, reward, terminated, info)`.
*   **`env.evaluate(config: FunctionConfigs | None = None)`**: Runs evaluation logic defined in the [Task](/concepts/task) (or the provided `config`). Returns evaluation result.
*   **`env.close()`**: Shuts down the environment. Saves the [Trajectory](/concepts/trajectory) if linked to a [Job](/concepts/job).
*   **`env.get_urls()`**: Returns URLs (`url`, `live_url`) for accessing/viewing the environment.
*   **`env.reset(configs: FunctionConfigs | None = None)`**: Resets state, often running setup steps. *Mostly used internally or for environments created without an initial Task.*
*   **`env._setup(...)` / `env._invoke_all(...)`**: Internal methods for running setup/evaluate/custom configurations defined in a [Task](/concepts/task).

## Observations

The `Observation` object returned by `env.step()` contains:

*   `screenshot` (str | None): Base64-encoded PNG string.
*   `text` (str | None): Optional text output (e.g., terminal, accessibility tree).

## Related Concepts

*   [Task](/concepts/task): Defines the environment type (`gym`), `setup`, and `evaluate` logic.
*   [Agent](/concepts/agent): Interacts with the Environment via the `step` and `predict` methods.
*   [Adapter](/concepts/adapter): Ensures actions passed to `step` are in the correct `CLA` format.
*   [Job](/concepts/job): Groups environment runs; linking happens via `@register_job` or `gym.make(job=...)`.
*   [Trajectory](/concepts/trajectory): The recording generated when a job-linked environment is closed.
