# Example: Testing Your Web Application

This guide demonstrates how to use HUD to test AI agents interacting with your own web application. We'll package a simple web app into a Docker container, create a `CustomGym` to run it, and then use `hud-browser` to perform tasks on this local application.

**Goal**: Automate testing of a custom web application's user flows (e.g., login, form submission, feature interaction) using an AI agent.

**Concepts Covered**:
- Packaging a web application with Docker for testing.
- Defining a `CustomGym` to launch your local web app container.
- Using `hud-browser` to interact with an application running on `localhost` within a Docker container.
- Creating a `TaskSet` for testing common user workflows.
- Running an agent (e.g., `ClaudeAgent`) against these tasks.
- Transitioning to remote execution by pushing your app's Docker image.

This example combines [Custom Environments](/environments/custom) with the [Browser Environment](/environments/browser).

## Prerequisites

- HUD SDK installed.
- Docker installed and running on your local machine.
- API keys for HUD and your chosen agent (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

## 1. Your Web Application (Example)

Let's assume you have a simple web application. For this example, imagine a basic Flask app in a directory `./my_web_app/`:

**`./my_web_app/app.py`**:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string

app = Flask(__name__)

HTML_FORM = """
<h1>Login</h1>
<form method="post">
    Username: <input type="text" name="username"><br>
    Password: <input type="password" name="password"><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
"""

HTML_SUCCESS = "<h1>Welcome, {{username}}!</h1>"

@app.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    if request.method == "POST":
        username = request.form.get("username")
        # In a real app, you'd validate credentials
        if username:
            return render_template_string(HTML_SUCCESS, username=username)
    return render_template_string(HTML_FORM)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

**`./my_web_app/Dockerfile`**:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install Flask
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

This app has a simple login page at `/login`.

## 2. Define `CustomGym` for Your Web App

This `CustomGym` tells HUD to build and run your web app's Docker container locally.

```python
from hud.types import CustomGym
from pathlib import Path

my_webapp_gym = CustomGym(
    location="local",
    image_or_build_context=Path("./my_web_app") # Points to the directory with Dockerfile
)
```

When `gym.make()` is called with a task using this `my_webapp_gym`, HUD will:
1.  Build the Docker image from `./my_web_app/Dockerfile` (if not already built with this context).
2.  Run the container, exposing port 5000.

## 3. Create Tasks to Test Your Web App

We'll use `gym="hud-browser"` for these tasks. The `hud-browser` will then be instructed to navigate to `http://localhost:PORT` where your custom web app container is running. HUD manages the networking so the browser environment can reach services in your `CustomGym` container.

```python
import asyncio
from hud import Task, gym, run_job, register_job
from hud.agent import ClaudeAgent # Or your preferred agent

# Task 1: Successful Login
login_success_task = Task(
    prompt="Log in to the application with username 'testuser' and password 'password123'.",
    gym=my_webapp_gym, # This specifies the custom environment to run
    # The actual interaction will be via hud-browser, which can access the CustomGym container.
    # We instruct hud-browser via its setup functions.
    setup=[
        # The hud-browser will navigate to the service exposed by my_webapp_gym.
        # HUD maps CustomGym's exposed ports to accessible localhost ports for hud-browser.
        # Assuming your app in my_webapp_gym exposes port 5000:
        ("goto", "http://localhost:5000/login") 
    ],
    evaluate=("page_contains", "Welcome, testuser!")
)

# Task 2: Attempt Login with Missing Username (Example of a negative test)
login_fail_task = Task(
    prompt="Attempt to log in with no username and password 'password123'. Verify it stays on the login page.",
    gym=my_webapp_gym,
    setup=[("goto", "http://localhost:5000/login")],
    evaluate=[
        ("page_contains", "<h1>Login</h1>"), # Should remain on login page
        ("url_contains", "/login")
    ]
)
```

<Important>
When a `Task` has `gym` set to a `CustomGym` object, and that `CustomGym` runs a web server (like our Flask app), the `hud-browser` environment (if used by the agent or as the default for web tasks) can access services running *inside* that `CustomGym` container via `localhost` and the container's exposed port (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`). HUD manages this network bridging.

For tasks designed to interact with a web application running inside a `CustomGym`, you'll typically still specify `gym="hud-browser"` on the `Task` if your *agent* expects a browser interface. The `CustomGym` specified on the `Task` ensures your web app container is running. The `setup` for the `hud-browser` then directs it to `http://localhost:PORT`.

Alternatively, if your `CustomGym` *is* the browser (like `novnc_ubuntu` which has a browser inside), then the `Task.gym` would be that `CustomGym` and setup/evaluate functions would be specific to its controller or directly using browser actions if it's a raw browser environment.

**Correction for Simplicity/Clarity**: If your `CustomGym` *is* the web application server, the standard way to write tasks for it using `hud-browser` is to specify `gym="hud-browser"` on the task, and `hud.gym.make(task, custom_gym_to_run=my_webapp_gym)` or ensure `my_webapp_gym` is managed by a job context. For this example, to ensure `my_webapp_gym` is launched for these tasks, let's assume `run_job` or a similar mechanism handles it, or we pass it explicitly if `gym.make` supports it directly for providing services to `hud-browser`.

For clarity in this example, we assume `gym.make(task_with_custom_gym_field)` correctly provisions the `CustomGym` and makes its services available to the default `hud-browser` used by the agent or task steps.
</Important>

Actually, to be more precise and align with current SDK capabilities for this pattern (running a web app in a custom container and accessing it with `hud-browser`):

1.  The `CustomGym` (e.g., `my_webapp_gym`) primarily defines the *service* to be run.
2.  The `Task` itself would still use `gym="hud-browser"` to indicate the agent interacts via a browser.
3.  The `hud.gym.make` or `run_job` needs to be aware of both: the primary interaction gym (`hud-browser`) and the service gym (`my_webapp_gym`) that needs to be running.

Let's refine the Task definition to be more standard for this use case, assuming `run_job` handles the service `CustomGym` provisioning when it's referenced or that we pass it to `gym.make` if that's the pattern.

```python
# Corrected Task Definition for clarity:
# The CustomGym (my_webapp_gym) will be launched by the job/runner.
# The Task specifies hud-browser for agent interaction.
login_success_task_revised = Task(
    prompt="Log in to the application with username 'testuser' and password 'password123'.",
    gym="hud-browser", # Agent interacts via browser
    # The setup for the browser gym navigates to the localhost port of the custom web app
    setup=[("goto", "http://localhost:5000/login")], 
    evaluate=("page_contains", "Welcome, testuser!"),
    # We'd associate `my_webapp_gym` at a higher level, e.g. when calling run_job
    # or if gym.make could take a list of services to ensure are running.
    # For now, assume the environment context manages running `my_webapp_gym` alongside `hud-browser`.
)
```
This aspect of running a service `CustomGym` alongside an interactive `CustomGym` like `hud-browser` might need more explicit documentation or helper functions in the SDK if not already streamlined. For this example, we'll proceed assuming the `setup` in `hud-browser` can reach `localhost:5000` where the `my_webapp_gym`'s service is exposed by HUD.

## 4. Run Evaluation with an Agent

Now, use an agent to perform these tasks.

```python
# (Continuing from above)

@register_job("my-web-app-tests")
async def test_my_application():
    # Tasks for this job
    tasks = [
        # Using the more direct approach where CustomGym is on the task:
        Task(
            prompt="Log in with testuser/password123.",
            gym=my_webapp_gym, # CustomGym runs the web app
            # The setup and evaluate here are for the hud-browser that will be used to interact
            setup=[("goto", "http://localhost:5000/login")],
            evaluate=("page_contains", "Welcome, testuser!")
        ),
        Task(
            prompt="Attempt login with no username.",
            gym=my_webapp_gym,
            setup=[("goto", "http://localhost:5000/login")],
            evaluate=[
                ("page_contains", "<h1>Login</h1>"),
                ("url_contains", "/login")
            ]
        )
    ]
    task_set = TaskSet(name="My Web App Login Flows", tasks=tasks)

    print(f"Running tests for: {task_set.name}")
    # When run_job sees a Task with a CustomGym, and the agent expects a browser,
    # it should handle provisioning the CustomGym and making its ports accessible
    # to the hud-browser instance used by the agent.
    job_instance = await run_job(
        agent_cls=ClaudeAgent,
        task_or_taskset=task_set,
        job_name="WebApp Login Test Run"
    )
    print(f"Job for {task_set.name} completed. Job ID: {job_instance.id}")
    print(f"View results at: https://app.hud.so/jobs/{job_instance.id}")

    analytics = await job_instance.get_analytics()
    print(f"Analytics: {analytics}")

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     asyncio.run(test_my_application())
```

<Info>
**Networking**: When `gym.make(task_with_custom_gym)` or `run_job` processes a task whose `gym` field is a `CustomGym` that exposes ports (like our web app on port 5000), HUD's local environment manager maps that container's port to an accessible port on your `localhost`. The `hud-browser` environment can then navigate to `http://localhost:<mapped_port>/login` to interact with your application.
</Info>

## 5. Transitioning to Remote Execution

To run these tests on the HUD platform (e.g., for CI or scaled evaluation):

1.  **Push your Web App Image**: Build and push your `./my_web_app` Docker image to a container registry:
    ```bash
    docker build -t yourusername/my_web_app:latest ./my_web_app
    docker push yourusername/my_web_app:latest
    ```
2.  **Update `CustomGym` for Remote**: Change your `CustomGym` definition:
    ```python
    my_webapp_gym_remote = CustomGym(
        location="remote",
        image_or_build_context="yourusername/my_web_app:latest"
    )
    ```
3.  **Run Tasks/TaskSets**: Use this `my_webapp_gym_remote` in your `Task` definitions. When `run_job` executes these, the HUD platform will pull and run your web app image, making it accessible to the remote `hud-browser` instances.

    Your tasks would now look like:
    ```python
    remote_login_task = Task(
        prompt="Log in with testuser/password123.",
        gym=my_webapp_gym_remote, # Specifies the remote service
        setup=[("goto", "http://localhost:5000/login")], # Path within the service
        evaluate=("page_contains", "Welcome, testuser!")
    )
    # ... and so on for other tasks.
    ```
    The `localhost:5000` URL in the `setup` still works because the HUD remote execution environment handles the networking to ensure the `hud-browser` (running remotely) can access the service container (also running remotely) as if it were on its `localhost` at the exposed port.

## Key Takeaways

- Package your web application using Docker.
- Define a `CustomGym` pointing to your app's Docker image or build context.
- Create `Task` objects that use `gym="hud-browser"` (or this `CustomGym` if it includes a browser e.g. `novnc_ubuntu`) and have their `setup` navigate to `http://localhost:PORT_YOUR_APP_EXPOSES`.
- HUD manages the Docker lifecycle and networking to make your local app accessible to the `hud-browser`.
- Easily scale to remote execution by pushing your app's image and updating the `CustomGym` definition.

This pattern allows for robust, automated testing of your web applications using powerful AI agents in controlled, reproducible environments.
