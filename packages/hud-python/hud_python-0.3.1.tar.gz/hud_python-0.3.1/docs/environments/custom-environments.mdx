# Custom Environments

While the HUD SDK provides standard environments like `"hud-browser"` and `"OSWorld-Ubuntu"`, you can also define and run your own custom environments using Docker. This allows you to create specific testing scenarios with custom software stacks or configurations.

Custom environments are defined using the `CustomGym` type from `hud.types`.

## Defining a Custom Environment (`CustomGym`)

```python
from hud.types import CustomGym
from pathlib import Path

# Example 1: Local Docker environment using a source directory
# Points to a directory containing controller code and a Dockerfile
local_env_spec = CustomGym(
    location="local",
    image_or_build_context=Path("./my_custom_controller") # Path to your controller code
)

# Example 2: Local Docker environment (using prebuilt image)
local_env_spec = CustomGym(
    location="local",
    image_or_build_context="local_image" # local docker images can be used when location is local
)

# Example 3: Remote Docker environment (using prebuilt image)
remote_env_spec = CustomGym(
    location="remote",
    image_or_build_context="hudevals/novnc-ubuntu:latest" # docker hub image name
)
```
**Key `CustomGym` Attributes:**

*   **`location` (`"local"` | `"remote"`):**
    *   `"local"`: Builds and runs the Docker container on your *local* machine. Requires Docker installed. Ideal for development. See [Local Environment Structure](#local-environment-structure) below.
    *   `"remote"`: Executes the prebuilt image on the HUD platform. Good for sharing or running complex setups.
*   **`image_or_build_context` (str | `Path`):**
    *   If string, it is interpreted as an image name. Both local and remote locations support this. One caveat is that local images are not supported when `location="remote"`, since the HUD platform does not have access to your local Docker daemon.
    *   If `Path`, it is interpreted as a directory containing a Dockerfile and other files needed to build the image. This is useful for local development. See [Local Environment Structure](#local-environment-structure) below.

## <a name="local-environment-structure"></a>Local Environment Structure

When creating a custom environment, the directory specified by `image_or_build_context` must contain:

1.  **`Dockerfile`:** Defines the base image, system dependencies, Python dependencies (often via `pip install -e .`), and installs your controller package.
2.  **`pyproject.toml`:** Defines your controller as an installable Python package. The package must be named `hud_controller`.
3.  **`src/`** A directory containing your Python controller code. This code needs to implement the functions called by `setup`, `evaluate`, and `step` (e.g., interacting with applications inside the container, returning observations).

**Example Structure (`./my_custom_controller/`):**

```
my_custom_controller/
├── Dockerfile
├── pyproject.toml
└── src/
    └── hud_controller/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── main.py        # Your controller logic (e.g., setup, step functions)
```

*   **Examples:** The top-level `environments/` directory in the SDK repository contains reference implementations (like `novnc_ubuntu`) following this structure.

## Using a Custom Environment

Use your `CustomGym` object with `hud.gym.make()`:

```python
from hud import gym
from hud.types import CustomGym

# Assuming local_env_spec = CustomGym(location="local", controller_source_dir="./my_custom_controller")
env = await gym.make(local_env_spec)

print("Custom local environment created.")

# Interact as usual - Task setup/evaluate calls functions in your controller
# task = Task(prompt="...", gym=local_env_spec, setup=("my_setup_func", arg1), ...)
# env = await gym.make(task)
# obs, _ = await env.reset()
# result = await env.evaluate()

await env.close()
```
### Hot Reloading

The HUD SDK supports hot reloading of controller code. When using a build context, if the controller code in the folder is updated, the SDK will automatically reinstall the controller package
without needing to rebuild the image.
This is done by:
1. Copying the controller code to a temporary directory.
2. `pip install -e . --break-system-packages` to install the controller package.

Note that docker images cannot be hot reloaded, and will only be rebuilt when a new environment is created.
