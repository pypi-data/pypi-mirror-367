# QA Environment

## Introduction

The `qa` environment is a specialized, non-interactive environment designed for question-answering tasks. The agent receives context or a question via the `Task.prompt` and is expected to provide a final text response.

## Setup

No environment-specific setup actions are typically required for `qa` tasks. The question or context is provided directly in the `Task.prompt`.

```python
from hud.task import Task

qa_task = Task(
    prompt="What is the powerhouse of the cell?",
    gym="qa" # Specify the QA environment
    # evaluate=... (see below)
)
```

Refer to [Task Setup Configuration](../concepts/task.mdx#setup-configuration) for the general concept of how setup steps *could* be defined in a Task, although they are generally not needed for `qa`.

## Step Interaction

Agents interact with the `qa` environment primarily by submitting their final answer.

*   The agent receives the `Task.prompt` in the initial `Observation`.
*   The agent processes the prompt and determines its answer.
*   The agent sends a single [`ResponseAction`](../advanced/cla-details.mdx#response-actions) containing the answer text to `env.step()`.

```python
# Agent predicts and sends this action:
from hud.adapters.common.types import ResponseAction

action = ResponseAction(text="Mitochondria")
# await env.step([action])
```

The environment stores the text from the first `ResponseAction` it receives in an internal `env.final_response` attribute for evaluation.

**Other CLAs:** While technically part of the [CLA standard](../advanced/cla-details.mdx), other actions (like `ClickAction`, `TypeAction`, `ScrollAction`, etc.) are not processed or relevant in the standard `qa` environment.

## Evaluate

Evaluation logic is defined in the `evaluate` attribute of the [Task](../concepts/task.mdx) and triggered by `env.evaluate()`. This logic compares the `env.final_response` (the text submitted by the agent via `ResponseAction`) against expected criteria.

Common evaluation methods for `qa` tasks:
*   **`response_includes(substring: str | list[str])`**: Checks if the response text contains the specified `substring` or *all* of the substrings in the provided list.
    ```python
    # Example Task Evaluation (single string):
    evaluate=("response_includes", "mitochondria") 
    # Example Task Evaluation (list of strings):
    # evaluate=("response_includes", ["powerhouse", "cell"]) 
    ```
*   **`response_is(expected_text: str)`**: Checks for an exact, case-sensitive match with the `expected_text`.
    ```python
    # Example Task Evaluation:
    evaluate=("response_is", "Mitochondria")
    ```
*   **`response_match(pattern: str)`**: Checks if the response text matches the provided regular expression `pattern`.
    ```python
    # Example Task Evaluation:
    evaluate=("response_match", r"^[Mm]itochondria.?$") # Case-insensitive, optional period
    ```

*Note: The exact names and availability of evaluation functions might evolve. Refer to specific evaluator documentation or examples for the most current details.*
