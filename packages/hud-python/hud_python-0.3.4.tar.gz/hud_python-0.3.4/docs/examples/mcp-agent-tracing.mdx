# Example: Tracing an MCP Agent

This guide demonstrates how to use HUD's telemetry to trace the interactions of an agent that utilizes the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for its tool-calling capabilities. This is invaluable for debugging agent behavior, understanding tool usage patterns, and analyzing performance.

We'll use a conceptual `MCPAgent` (similar to agents built with `mcp-use` or other MCP-compliant libraries) that interacts with a mock Airbnb MCP server.

**Goal**: Trace an agent as it uses an MCP tool (e.g., an Airbnb search tool) to find accommodation information, potentially within the context of a HUD browser task.

**Concepts Covered**:
- Setting up an `MCPClient` with server configurations.
- Using `hud.trace()` to automatically capture MCP calls.
- Integrating MCP agent actions with HUD environments (e.g., `hud-browser` or `qa`).
- Viewing MCP call details (requests, responses, errors, timing) in the HUD platform.

## Prerequisites

- HUD SDK installed.
- An MCP-enabled agent library (e.g., `mcp-use`).
- API keys for HUD and any LLM used by the agent (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- An MCP server available (for this example, we simulate one based on an Airbnb example).

## Step 1: Configure MCP Client and Agent

First, set up the `MCPClient` to connect to your tool server(s) and initialize your `MCPAgent`.

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Assuming you have mcp-use or a similar library
from mcp_use import MCPAgent, MCPClient 
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI # Or your preferred LLM provider

import hud
from hud import gym, Task
from hud.adapters import ResponseAction # For submitting final text to HUD env

# Load environment variables (e.g., API keys)
load_dotenv()

# Configure logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.getLogger("hud").setLevel(logging.DEBUG) # See HUD SDK logs

# Example MCP server configuration (replace with your actual server setup)
# This simulates an MCP server for Airbnb search that can be run via npx.
mcp_server_config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "airbnb_search_tool": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@openbnb/mcp-server-airbnb", "--ignore-robots-txt"], # Example package
            "env": {"IGNORE_ROBOTS_TXT": "true"} 
        }
    }
}

# Initialize MCPClient and MCPAgent
mcp_client = MCPClient.from_dict(mcp_server_config)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o") # Configure your LLM

# This agent will use tools available via MCP servers defined in mcp_client
mcp_agent = MCPAgent(
    llm=llm, 
    client=mcp_client, 
    max_steps=10, # Max MCP tool calls per .run()
    verbose=True # Set to False for less mcp-use library logging
)
```

<Note>
The `mcp_server_config` above is just an example, you can use any MCP-compliant tool server.
</Note>

## Step 2: Define a Task (Optional HUD Environment Interaction)

Your MCP agent might operate independently or its results might be used in a HUD environment.

**Scenario A: MCP Agent acts, then updates a HUD Browser Task**

```python
# Task for the HUD Browser environment
browser_task = Task(
    prompt=(
        "Find a pet-friendly Airbnb in Barcelona for 2 adults for a week in August "
        "with good reviews. Summarize the top 3 options."
    ),
    gym="hud-browser", # Agent will use MCP tools, then might interact with browser
    setup=("goto", "https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/Barcelona"), # Initial browser page
    evaluate=("response_includes", ["Barcelona", "pool", "pet-friendly"]) # Check final response
)
```

**Scenario B: MCP Agent uses tools, task is primarily QA (no browser interaction)**

```python
qa_task = Task(
    prompt=(
        "Using available tools, find a pet-friendly Airbnb in Barcelona for 2 adults for a week "
        "in August with good reviews. Provide a summary of the top option."
    ),
    gym="qa", # No interactive browser needed for the agent's core work
    evaluate=("response_includes", ["Barcelona", "pet-friendly"])
)
```

## Step 3: Run Agent with HUD Telemetry Tracing

Wrap the agent's execution in `hud.trace()` to capture all MCP calls.

```python
# (Continuing from previous setup)

async def run_mcp_agent_with_tracing(task_definition: Task):
    logger.info(f"Starting task: {task_definition.prompt}")

    with hud.trace(name="airbnb_search_mcp_trace", attributes={"city": "Barcelona", "agent_type": "MCPAgent"}):
        # Initialize HUD environment if the task uses one
        env = await gym.make(task_definition)
        await env.reset() # Runs task_definition.setup

        logger.info("Running MCP agent...")
        # The MCPAgent.run() method will make one or more MCP calls to its configured servers.
        # These calls (requests, responses, errors, timings) will be captured by hud.trace.
        try:
            agent_final_output = await mcp_agent.run(
                task_definition.prompt # Agent receives the main prompt
            )
            logger.info(f"MCPAgent final output: {agent_final_output}")
            
            # Submit the agent's final textual output to the HUD environment for evaluation
            # This is crucial if your Task.evaluate depends on ResponseAction
            if agent_final_output and isinstance(agent_final_output, str):
                await env.step([ResponseAction(text=agent_final_output)])
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"MCPAgent run failed: {e}")
            agent_final_output = f"Agent error: {e}" # Log error as part of the output
            # Optionally submit error as a response if needed for evaluation logic
            await env.step([ResponseAction(text=agent_final_output)])

        # Evaluate the task based on its definition (e.g., checking browser state or agent_final_output)
        evaluation_result = await env.evaluate()
        logger.info(f"HUD Evaluation Result: {evaluation_result}")
        
        await env.close()
        logger.info("Environment closed.")
        
    # The trace is automatically submitted at the end of the `with` block.
    # View it on app.hud.so/jobs/traces/{trace_id} (trace_id logged by HUD)

# Example of how to run it:
# async def main():
#     # hud.init_telemetry() # Ensure telemetry is initialized
#     await run_mcp_agent_with_tracing(browser_task) # or qa_task
#     await asyncio.sleep(10) # Allow time for background telemetry export
#     hud.flush() # Ensure all telemetry is sent before exiting

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     asyncio.run(main())
```

## Step 4: Analyzing MCP Traces in HUD

After the run, navigate to your trace URL (logged by HUD, typically `https://app.hud.so/jobs/traces/{trace_id}`).

**In the HUD trace view, you will see:**
- **Trace Overview**: Name, attributes, duration.
- **MCP Calls List**: Each MCP interaction made by the agent.
    - **Request**: The method and parameters sent to the MCP server.
    - **Response**: The result or error returned by the MCP server.
    - **Timing**: Duration of each MCP call.
    - **Status**: Success or failure of the call.
- **HUD Environment Interactions**: If the agent also interacted with a HUD environment (like `hud-browser`), those CLA actions will also be part of the overall job trajectory associated with this trace (though the MCP trace focuses on the tool calls).

This detailed view allows you to debug issues like:
- Incorrect tool parameters.
- Unexpected errors from MCP servers.
- Slow tool performance.
- The sequence of tools an agent chose to use.

## Decorator for Tracing Functions

If your MCP agent logic is encapsulated in a function, you can use the `@hud.register_trace` decorator:

```python
@hud.register_trace(name="find_accommodation_mcp")
async def find_accommodation(prompt_query: str, agent_instance: MCPAgent):
    logger.info(f"Agent received query: {prompt_query}")
    # All MCP calls made by agent_instance.run() here will be traced.
    result = await agent_instance.run(prompt_query)
    return result

# Later in your code:
# accommodation_summary = await find_accommodation("Book a hotel in Paris", mcp_agent)
```

## Key Takeaways

- `hud.trace()` automatically captures MCP calls made by compatible agents (like those from `mcp-use`).
- This works whether the MCP agent is interacting with a HUD environment or operating with its own set of tools.
- Traces provide deep visibility into tool usage, essential for debugging and optimizing complex agents.
- Combine MCP tracing with HUD environments to evaluate both tool use and interaction with UIs like browsers.
