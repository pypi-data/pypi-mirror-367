# Page Cloning

This guide demonstrates how to create and host web archives for testing AI agents with consistent, offline-first environments. By cloning websites into WACZ (Web ARChiveZip) files, you can ensure your agents always test against specific, unchanging versions of web pages.

**Goal**: Create reproducible web environments for testing browser-based agents without depending on live websites that might change or go offline.

**Concepts Covered**:
- Using ArchiveWeb.page to clone websites into WACZ files
- Hosting archives locally with the HUD page archives repository and `CustomGym`
- Uploading archives to app.hud.so for immediate cloud hosting
- Creating tasks that use these stable archived environments

## Prerequisites

- HUD SDK installed
- Docker installed (for local hosting option)
- ArchiveWeb.page browser extension (for cloning pages)
- API keys for HUD and your chosen agent

## Part 1: Cloning the Page

### Installing ArchiveWeb.page

1. **Install the Browser Extension**:
   - Visit [ArchiveWeb.page](https://archiveweb.page)
   - Install the extension for Chrome/Chromium-based browsers
   - The extension icon will appear in your browser toolbar

2. **Create a New Archive**:
   - Click the ArchiveWeb.page extension icon
   - Click "Create New Collection"
   - Give your collection a descriptive name (e.g., "my-test-site")

### Capturing Web Pages

1. **Start Archiving**:
   - Click "Start" in the extension popup to begin an archiving session
   - Navigate to the website you want to clone
   - Interact with the site as your agent would (login, navigate through pages, fill forms)
   - All pages and resources will be captured automatically

2. **Best Practices for Agent Testing**:
   - Capture all relevant pages and states your agent will interact with
   - Include error pages and edge cases
   - If testing login flows, capture both logged-out and logged-in states
   - For form submissions, capture the form page and success/error pages

3. **Stop and Download**:
   - Click "Stop" in the extension when done capturing
   - Click "Download" to save your collection
   - Choose WACZ format (default)
   - Save with a meaningful filename (e.g., `my-test-site.wacz`)

### Example: Cloning a Login Flow

```
1. Start archiving session
2. Visit https://example.com/login
3. Enter test credentials (e.g., testuser/password123)
4. Submit the form
5. Capture the dashboard/welcome page
6. Optionally capture logout flow
7. Stop and download as my-test-site.wacz
```

## Part 2: Hosting the Website

You have two options for hosting your archived website:

### Option 1: Local Hosting with CustomGym

This approach uses the [HUD page archives repository](https://github.com/hud-evals/page-archives) to host archives locally and access them via `CustomGym`.

#### Step 1: Clone the Page Archives Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hud-evals/page-archives.git
cd page-archives
```

#### Step 2: Add Your Archive

1. **Place your WACZ file**:
   ```bash
   cp ~/Downloads/my-test-site.wacz archives/
   ```

2. **Update `archives/archive_list.json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "archives": [
       {
         "name": "my-test-site",
         "displayName": "My Test Site Archive",
         "startPage": "https://example.com/login"  // Optional: default page to open
       }
       // ... other archives
     ]
   }
   ```
   
   Note: The `name` field must match your WACZ filename without the `.wacz` extension.

#### Step 3: Create a CustomGym for the Archive Server

```python
from hud.types import CustomGym
from pathlib import Path

# Create a Dockerfile for the archive server
archive_server_dockerfile = """
FROM node:18-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
"""

# Save Dockerfile in the page-archives directory
with open("page-archives/Dockerfile", "w") as f:
    f.write(archive_server_dockerfile)

# Define the CustomGym
archive_server_gym = CustomGym(
    location="local",
    image_or_build_context=Path("./page-archives"),
    host_config={
        "port_bindings": {3000: 3000}  # Expose port 3000
    }
)
```

#### Step 4: Create Tasks Using the Archived Site

```python
from hud import Task, run_job
from hud.agent import ClaudeAgent

# Task to test login flow on the archived site
login_task = Task(
    prompt="Log into the website using username 'testuser' and password 'password123'.",
    gym="hud-browser",  # Use browser to interact
    setup=[
        # Navigate to your archived site running locally
        ("goto", "http://localhost:3000/my-test-site")
    ],
    evaluate=("page_contains", "Welcome, testuser!")
)
```

#### Advanced: Query Parameters

The archive viewer supports useful query parameters:

```python
# Open a specific page within the archive
specific_page_task = Task(
    prompt="Navigate to the user profile page",
    gym="hud-browser",
    setup=[
        ("goto", "http://localhost:3000/my-test-site?page=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fprofile")
    ]
)

# Debug mode - shows full ReplayWeb.page UI
debug_task = Task(
    prompt="Explore the archive interface",
    gym="hud-browser",
    setup=[
        ("goto", "http://localhost:3000/my-test-site?debug=true")
    ]
)
```

### Option 2: Cloud Hosting on app.hud.so

For immediate hosting without local setup, use the HUD platform's built-in page cloning feature.

#### Step 1: Access Page Clone Feature

1. Go to [app.hud.so](https://app.hud.so)
2. Click "Create" in the navigation
3. Select "Page Clone"

#### Step 2: Upload Your Archive

1. Click "Upload WACZ file"
2. Select your `.wacz` file created in Part 1
3. Provide a name for your cloned environment
4. Click "Create"

#### Step 3: Use the Hosted Archive

Once uploaded, you'll receive a URL for your hosted archive (e.g., `https://archives.hud.so/your-archive-id`).

```python
from hud import Task, run_job
from hud.agent import ClaudeAgent

# Task using the cloud-hosted archive
cloud_login_task = Task(
    prompt="Log into the website using username 'testuser' and password 'password123'.",
    gym="hud-browser",
    setup=[
        # Navigate to your cloud-hosted archive
        ("goto", "https://archives.hud.so/your-archive-id")
    ],
    evaluate=("page_contains", "Welcome, testuser!")
)

# Run evaluation
job = await run_job(
    agent_cls=ClaudeAgent,
    task_or_taskset=cloud_login_task,
    job_name="Cloud Archive Test"
)
```

## Tips for Effective Page Cloning

1. **Capture Complete Flows**: Don't just capture individual pages - capture entire user journeys
2. **Include Resources**: Ensure CSS, JavaScript, and images are properly captured
3. **Test Your Archives**: Always verify your archives work correctly before using them in evaluations
4. **Document States**: Keep notes on what states and pages are included in each archive
5. **Update Regularly**: Re-clone sites when significant changes occur
