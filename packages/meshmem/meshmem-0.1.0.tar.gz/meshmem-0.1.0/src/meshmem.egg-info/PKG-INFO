# MeshMem SDK

**MeshMem‚Ñ¢** is the protocol-native, event-driven SDK for composable, auditable, and lawful cognitive memory in AI and multi-agent systems‚Äîbuilt and governed by Consenix Group Ltd.

---

## üöÄ What is MeshMem?

**MeshMem turns any agent, LLM app, or distributed system into a protocol-governed, semantically continuous, and auditable cognitive agent.**
It‚Äôs more than an ‚ÄúAI memory‚Äù layer‚Äîit‚Äôs the full, lawful substrate for composable, explainable, and capitalizable mesh cognition.

---

## üèÜ Key Capabilities

* **Field-complete Cognitive Memory Blocks (CMBs):**  
  Structured, protocol-auditable memory with symbolic fields and vectors‚Äînot just blobs or chunks.

* **Lawful Memory Evolution:**  
  Every memory change (creation, remix, clarification, canonization) is a protocol event‚Äîfully logged, validator/auditor-signed, and auditable.

* **Protocol-grade Semantic Fusion (SVAF):**  
  Field-wise, mathematically rigorous, drift-bounded fusion; no more ‚Äújust average the embeddings.‚Äù

* **Semantic Drift Detection & Clarifier Logic:**  
  Built-in drift detection and clarifier agents maintain mesh-wide semantic continuity.

* **Full Auditability & Regulatory Compliance:**  
  Every event is protocol-logged: who, what, when, why, and how.

* **Composable, Programmable Mesh Memory:**  
  Remix, clarify, and canonize memories into cognitive assets‚Äîready for assetization, staking, and multi-agent collaboration.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Quickstart

**Install from PyPI:**

```bash
pip install meshmem
```

**From source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meshmem/meshmem-sdk.git
cd meshmem-sdk
pip install -e .
```

> See [`examples/`](./examples/) for ready-to-run demos.

---

### ‚ö° Minimal Example

```python
from meshmem import create, remix, clarify

raw_input = "List the main compliance and technical risks for Q4."
cmb, audit = create(raw_input, api_key="sk-...")

# Fuse with anchor CMBs
fused_cmb, remix_audit = remix(cmb, [cmb2, cmb3])

# Clarify semantic drift
decision, clarifier_audit = clarify(fused_cmb, drift_scores={"block": remix_audit["svaf_details"]["block_drift"]}, config={...})
```

### **Feature Comparison Table**

| Feature            | MeshMem (SDK)                                  | LangMem / MemGPT / etc.       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Memory Structure   | Protocol-defined CMBs, fields, vectors, labels | ‚ÄúChunks‚Äù, text blobs, vectors |
| Semantic Alignment | Field-wise, drift-bounded SVAF fusion          | Heuristic, vector avg/concat  |
| Drift Detection    | Built-in, protocol-governed, clarifier logic   | Rare or ad hoc                |
| Audit Trail        | Validator-signed, event-driven, forensic       | Minimal or app-level          |
| Governance         | Mesh protocol law, validator circles, RFCs     | None or app-specific          |
| Assetization       | Canonize as programmable assets (MCATs, etc.)  | No, or only as DB records     |
| Compliance         | Native, protocol-signed, explainable           | No protocol, no compliance    |
| Mesh/Inter-agent   | Designed for mesh/collab cognition across orgs | Agent-local or per-app        |

**Bottom Line:**
MeshMem does for AI memory what blockchain did for transactions:
It makes memory lawful, composable, auditable, and programmable‚Äîenabling collective intelligence, regulatory compliance, and epistemic assetization.
