## Modifying an Existing Configuration

The user has a valid PullApprove configuration and needs help making changes.

### Your Task

1. Read the existing CODEREVIEW.toml and validate with `pullapprove check`
2. Understand the requested changes (new scopes, reviewers, requirements, etc.)
3. Make minimal, targeted modifications preserving existing functionality
4. Test changes with `pullapprove files` and re-validate

Common scenarios: adding teams/scopes, changing review thresholds, implementing ownership models, configuring author-based rules.

Reference `pullapprove docs` for configuration options.
