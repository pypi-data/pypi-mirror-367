TODO: This module is experimental... Be careful.

This is a class to keep the code that allows me to
insert an image into another image that contains
a greenscreen region but that is not rectangular,
so we need to make some transformations to fit the
expected region and position.

TODO: Please, this is not fine at all and need 
review, work and love
