    create an idle event against the asset. The distance_tolerance should be

    time_tolerance value, to avoid triggering idle events when the asset is crossing
    a busy intersection or waiting at the traffic lights.

    Use this parameter to configure a time duration for which the monitor would
    track the distance covered by an asset before triggering an idle event. The
    time_tolerance should be provided in milliseconds.

    If the distance covered by the asset during a time_tolerance is less than that
    specified in distance_tolerance the asset will be assumed to be idle.

    Please observe that this attribute along with distance_tolerance parameter can
    be used to control the "sensitivity" of the monitor with respect to idle alerts.
    If the distance_tolerance is set a high value, then setting time_tolerance to a
    low value may result in a situation where asset is always judged as idle. On the
    contrary, it might never be judged as idle if distance_tolerance is set to a low
    value but time_tolerance is set to a high value.

    It is recommended to use these properties with appropriate values to trigger
    genuine idle events. The appropriate values might depend on the traffic

    and other factors.
