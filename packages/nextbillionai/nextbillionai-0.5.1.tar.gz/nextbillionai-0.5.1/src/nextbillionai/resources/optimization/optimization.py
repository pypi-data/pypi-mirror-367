        Optimized routing between way points

        Highly accurate ETAs with customized routes

        Roundtrip optimization with customized destinations

        A list of all parameters is specified in the next section.

        Args:
          coordinates: This is a pipe-separated list of coordinates.

              Minimum 3 pairs of coordinates and Maximum 12 pairs of coordinates are allowed.

          key: A key is a unique identifier that is required to authenticate a request to the
              API.

          approaches: A semicolon-separated list indicating the side of the road from which to
              approach waypoints in a requested route. If provided, the number of approaches
              must be the same as the number of coordinates. However, you can skip a
              coordinate and show its position in the list with the ; separator.

          destination: Specify the destination coordinate of the returned route. If the input is last,
              the last coordinate will be the destination.

          geometries: Sets the output format of the route geometry in the response.

              On providing polyline and polyline6 as input, respective encoded geometry is
              returned. However, when geojson is provided as the input value, polyline encoded
              geometry is returned in the response along with a geojson details of the route.

          mode: Set which driving mode the service should use to determine a route. For example,
              if you use "car", the API will return a route that a car can take. Using "truck"
              will return a route a truck can use, taking into account appropriate truck
              routing restrictions.

              When "mode=truck", following are the default dimensions that are used:

              \\-- truck_height = 214 centimeters

              \\-- truck_width = 183 centimeters

              \\-- truck_length = 519 centimeters

              \\-- truck_weight = 5000 kg

              Please use the Directions Flexible version if you want to use custom truck
              dimensions.

              Note: Only the "car" profile is enabled by default. Please note that customized
              profiles (including "truck") might not be available for all regions. Please
              contact your [NextBillion.ai](http://NextBillion.ai) account manager, sales
              representative or reach out at
              [support@nextbillion.ai](mailto:support@nextbillion.ai) in case you need
              additional profiles.

          roundtrip: Indicates whether the returned route is a roundtrip.

          source: The coordinate at which to start the returned route. If this is not configured,
              the return routeâ€™s destination will be the first coordinate.

          with_geometry: Indicates whether the return geometry should be computed or not.

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

                  full, original location list and update it in the following manner before
                  adding it to the re-optimization input:

                  1.  Ensure to not update the indexes of locations which just need to be
                      "modified".
                  2.  Add new location coordinates towards the end of the list.

              their individual requirements for re-optimization. Any shipment from the

              1.  Don't provide the locations input when re-optimizing, if the original set
                  contains all the required location coordinates.
              2.  If any new location coordinates are required for re-optimization, copy the
                  full, original location list and update it in the following manner before
                  adding it to the re-optimization input:

                  1.  Ensure to not update the indexes of locations which just need to be
                      "modified".
                  2.  Add new location coordinates towards the end of the list.

          shipment_changes: This section gathers information on modifications to the number of shipments or
              their individual requirements for re-optimization. Any shipment from the
              original solution not specified here will be re-planned without alteration
              during the re-optimization process.

          vehicle_changes: This section gathers information on modifications to the number of vehicles or
              individual vehicle configurations for re-optimizing an existing solution. Any
              vehicle from the original solution not specified here will be reused without
              alteration during the re-optimization process.
