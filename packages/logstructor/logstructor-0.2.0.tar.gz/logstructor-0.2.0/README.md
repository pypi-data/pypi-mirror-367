# LogStructor

## The Problem: Your Logs Are Useless

Try finding anything in this mess:

```
2025-01-08 10:30:45 INFO: User alice from 192.168.1.100 failed login attempt 3
2025-01-08 10:31:12 INFO: Processing order for customer 456 amount $99.99
2025-01-08 10:31:45 ERROR: Database connection timeout after 30 seconds
2025-01-08 10:32:01 INFO: Order ORD-789 completed successfully
```

Now ask yourself: Which user experienced the database timeout? How many failed logins did alice have today? Which orders failed due to timeouts?

With unstructured text logs, you can't easily answer any of these questions. You can‚Äôt search, filter, or analyze them in a meaningful way.

## The Solution: Few Lines of Code

```python
import logstructor

logger = logstructor.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Login failed", user_id="alice", ip="192.168.1.100", attempt=3)
```

**Result:**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-08T10:30:45Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Login failed",
  "context": {
    "user_id": "alice",
    "ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "attempt": 3
  }
}
```

**Now you can actually search your logs in ELK, Splunk, or any log aggregator:**

```bash
# Find all of alice's actions across all services
user_id:"alice"

# Find users with multiple failed attempts (security alert!)
attempt:>2

# Complex queries become possible
user_id:"alice" AND level:"ERROR" AND timestamp:[now-1h TO now]
```

**Before:** Grep through gigabytes of text files ‚ùå<br>
**After:** Instant search and filtering ‚úÖ

## Get Started

Installing and using LogStructor is simple:

```bash
pip install logstructor
```

Replace the standard logger:

```python
import logstructor

logger = logstructor.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Hello structured world", excited=True)
```

That‚Äôs it ‚Äî structured logs with context, ready for debugging and monitoring.

## Why Developers Love It

### 1. Works in 30 seconds

```python
import logstructor

logger = logstructor.getLogger(__name__)
# Done. You're logging structured data.
```

### 2. Context that actually works

```python
# Set once per request
logstructor.bind_context(request_id="req-123", user_id=456)

# Every log automatically includes request_id and user_id
logger.info("Started processing")
logger.info("Validation passed")
logger.error("Database timeout")
logger.info("Request completed")

# Clean up
logstructor.clear_context()
```

**Works with async/await:**

```python
async def handle_request():
    logstructor.bind_context(request_id="req-123")
    
    await authenticate_user()  # Context preserved across await
    logger.info("User authenticated")
    
    await process_data()       # Still has request_id
    logger.info("Processing complete")
```

### 3. Drop-in replacement

```python
# Your existing code works unchanged
logger.info("Server started")
logger.error("Connection failed", exc_info=True)

# Just add structure when you want it
logger.info("Server started", port=8080, workers=4)
logger.error("Connection failed", host="db.example.com", timeout=30)
```

## Why Not structlog?

[structlog](https://www.structlog.org/) is fantastic for complex logging pipelines, but it requires learning a completely new API and philosophy. LogStructor takes a different approach:

| Aspect               | LogStructor                      | structlog                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Learning curve**   | Zero - uses standard logging API | Steep - new concepts and API         |
| **Migration effort** | Drop-in replacement              | Rewrite all logging calls            |
| **Dependencies**     | Zero                             | Multiple (including optional ones)   |
| **Complexity**       | Minimal - just structured fields | High - processors, contextvars, etc. |
| **Use case**         | 80% of structured logging needs  | Complex logging architectures        |
