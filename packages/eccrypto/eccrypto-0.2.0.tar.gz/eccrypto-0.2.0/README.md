A pure Python library for **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** ‚Äî built from scratch with clarity and educational readability in mind.
Supports digital signatures (ECDSA), key generation, and secure field arithmetic over common curves like `secp256k1`, `P-256`, and more.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Finite field arithmetic over prime fields (`FieldElement`)
- Curve definition (`Curve` and `Point`)
- ECC point addition, doubling, and scalar multiplication
- Key pair generation (`keys.py`)
- ECDSA signature generation and verification (`ecdsa.py`)
- Built-in support for popular curves (`secp256k1`, `P-256`, `brainpool`, etc.)
- Easy-to-understand documentation in every module for educational purposes

## üì¶ Installation

### From PyPI:
```bash
pip install eccrypto
```

## üîç Quick Examples

### üîë Key Generation

```python
from ecc import generate_keypair
from ecc import secp256k1

priv, pub = generate_keypair(secp256k1)

print("Private Key:\n", priv)
print("Public Key:\n", pub)
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è ECDSA Sign & Verify

```python
from ecc import secp256k1
from ecc import generate_keypair
from ecc import sign, verify

priv, pub = generate_keypair(secp256k1)

msg = b"Heyy! :D"
signature = sign(msg, priv)
print("Signature:", signature)

valid = verify(msg, signature, pub)

if valid:
    print("The signtature is valid!")
```

### üìå Curve and Point Usage

```python
from ecc import Curve, Point

a, b = 2, 2             # Curve: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2

P = 17                  # Prime modulus
G = (5, 1)              # Generator Point
n = 19                  # Number of points in E(Z/17Z)

curve = Curve(a, b, P, G, n)
print(curve)

G = Point(5, 1, curve)
print("Generator point: ", G)

P  = 2 * G              # Scalar Multiplication
P1 = P + P              # Point Addition

print("2G = ", P)
print("2G + 2G = ", P1)
```

### üî¢ Field Arithmetic

```python
from ecc import FieldElement

a = FieldElement(7, 13)
b = FieldElement(8, 13)

print("a + b =", a + b)
print("a * b =", a * b)
print("a ** -1 =", a ** -1)  # Inverse of a
```

## üß™ Testing

You can run the test suite using pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

All tests are located in the `tests/` directory and cover field arithmetic, point operations, key generation, and ECDSA functionality.

## ü§ù Contributions Welcome

PRs for adding new curves, improving documentation, and optimizations are welcome. Please make sure all tests pass.
