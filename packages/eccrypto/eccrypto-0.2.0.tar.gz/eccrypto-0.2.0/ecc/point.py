"""
This module defines the Point class for elliptic curve cryptography.

It includes the implementation of elliptic curve group operations such
as point addition and constant-time scalar multiplication using a
Montgomery Ladder to protect against side-channel attacks.

Definition of Point on the curve : y² = x³ + ax + b

Group operation for the elliptic curve.
The operations are:
                  - Addition
                  - Scalar Multiplication
