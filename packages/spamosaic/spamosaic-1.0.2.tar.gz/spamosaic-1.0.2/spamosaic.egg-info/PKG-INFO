# SpaMosaic

**SpaMosaic** is a Python package for spatial multi-omics data integration using contrastive learning and graph neural networks. It supports integration of partially overlapping modalities and facilitates downstream analyses such as spatial domain identification and modality imputation.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Horizontal integration**: integrates multiple slices within a single modality
- **Vertical integration**: integrates multiple modalities measured from the same slice
- **Mosaic integration**: integrates multiple slices with overallping modalities 
- **Imputation**: imputes expression profiles of missing omics

---

## ðŸš€ Installation

We recommend using Python 3.8+ and a Conda environment:

```bash
pip install spamosaic
```
