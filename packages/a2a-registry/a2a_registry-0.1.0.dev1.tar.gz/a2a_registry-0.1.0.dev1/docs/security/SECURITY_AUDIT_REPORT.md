### Risk Acceptance Decision

**RECOMMENDATION**: Do not proceed with AgentExtension architecture deployment until Critical (Priority 1) and High Priority (Priority 2) security controls are implemented and validated.

The security risks identified in this audit pose unacceptable threats to agent infrastructure integrity, data confidentiality, and operational availability. Implementation of the recommended security controls is essential for safe operation of the AgentExtension system.
