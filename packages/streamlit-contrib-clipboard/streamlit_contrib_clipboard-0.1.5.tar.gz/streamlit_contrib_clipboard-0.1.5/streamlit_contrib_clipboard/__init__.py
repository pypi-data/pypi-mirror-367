"""
streamlit_contrib_clipboard
===========================

This package exposes a helper function for copying text to the clipboard
from within Streamlit apps.  It wraps a small custom component built
in React which uses the modern clipboard API and fallâ€‘backs to work
reliably even when your app runs inside an iframe (such as on Streamlit
Community Cloud).

Example usage:

    from streamlit_contrib_clipboard import st_copy_to_clipboard
    st_copy_to_clipboard("Hello, World!", label="Copy greeting")

See the README for more details.
