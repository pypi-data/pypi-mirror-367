# Streamlit Contrib Clipboard

`streamlit-contrib-clipboard` is a lightweight Streamlit component that lets your app copy arbitrary text to the userâ€™s clipboard.  Unlike many existing approaches which silently fail when your app is embedded in an iframe (for example on Streamlit Community Cloud), this component uses modern clipboard APIs with sensible fallâ€‘backs so it works reliably.

## Installation

Install the package via pip.  Youâ€™ll need Python 3.8 or newer and Streamlit 1.20 or higher:

```bash
pip install streamlit-contrib-clipboard
```

## Usage

Import the component and call `st_copy_to_clipboard` anywhere in your Streamlit app.  Pass the text you want copied along with an optional label for the button.

```python
from streamlit_contrib_clipboard import st_copy_to_clipboard

# Copy a simple message
st_copy_to_clipboard("Hello, World!", label="Copy Greeting")

# Copy the current timestamp
import datetime
timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
st_copy_to_clipboard(timestamp, label="ðŸ“‹ Copy Timestamp")
```

When the user clicks the button the provided text is copied to their clipboard.  A short success message is displayed when the copy succeeds, and an error is shown when the browser denies clipboard access (for example on nonâ€‘HTTPS pages or older browsers).

## Features

- âœ… **Works inside iframes** â€“ uses the modern `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` API with fallâ€‘backs to ensure copy operations work even when your Streamlit app is embedded in another page.
- ðŸ”’ **Secure contexts** â€“ gracefully degrades when running over plain HTTP or in unsupported browsers.
- ðŸš€ **Simple API** â€“ just call `st_copy_to_clipboard(text, label)` from your app.
- ðŸ’¬ **Visual feedback** â€“ optional toast messages inform the user when copy succeeds or fails.

## Limitations

- Clipboard write access requires a user gesture (button click).  The component cannot automatically copy text without interaction.
- The component must run in a secure context (HTTPS or localhost).  On insecure pages the copy operation will be blocked.
- Older browsers may only support the fallâ€‘back strategy which uses `document.execCommand()`; this approach is deprecated and may fail in sandboxed iframes.

## Demo

This repository includes a small demo application in the `demo/` directory.  You can run it locally with:

```bash
streamlit run demo/app.py
```

On Streamlit Community Cloud the component works even though your app is embedded in an iframe.

## Development

The component is implemented as a custom Streamlit component with a React frontâ€‘end.  The frontâ€‘end lives in `streamlit_contrib_clipboard/frontend`.  After making changes to the JavaScript, run `npm install` and `npm run build` in that directory, then reâ€‘run your Streamlit app to load the updated component.
