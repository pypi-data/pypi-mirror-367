OMEGAlpes Structure
===================

The models are bases on **general**, **energy** and **actor** classes.
The structure of the library is described on the following class diagrams:

The energy units are detailed in the energy package

The energy package also includes an exergy module

The **actor classes** enables to build the energy model considering pre-defined
stakeholders' constraints and objectives

The **general classes** helps to build the units, the model and to plot the results
