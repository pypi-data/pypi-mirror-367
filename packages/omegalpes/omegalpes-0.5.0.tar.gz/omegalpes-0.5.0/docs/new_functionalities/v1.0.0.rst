What’s new in version 0.5.0
===========================
Version available since ...

Bug fixed
---------

Storage Units
****************
- e_min and e_max for both charging and discharging can be defined
- The issues related to the charging and discharging rates of the storage unit have been resolved.
- The issue causing a KeyError: 'storage_e_f_min' when directly specifying e_f — due to the model incorrectly adding constraints involving non-optimization variables—has been resolved.

Storage Units
****************
- StorageUnit updated from EnergyUnit to AssemblyUnit
- Possibility to assign the capacity without assigning the maximum power of charging and discharging, default value equals to capacity value
- e_min and e_max for both charging and discharging can be defined
- The issues related to the charging and discharging rates of the storage unit have been resolved.
- A new constraint, ef_geq_e0, has been added to the storage unit to softly enforce that the final state of charge (SOC) is at least equal to the initial SOC
- The issue causing a KeyError: 'storage_e_f_min' when directly specifying e_f — due to the model incorrectly adding constraints involving non-optimization variables—has been resolved.
