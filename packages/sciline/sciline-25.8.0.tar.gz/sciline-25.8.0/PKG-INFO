# Sciline

## About

Build scientific pipelines for your data.
Sciline uses a dependency-injection mechanism to build task graphs that can be executed, e.g., with a Dask scheduler.

See the [documentation](https://scipp.github.io/sciline/) for details.

## Installation

```sh
python -m pip install sciline
```
