init-script-without-chkconfig-postin="""
The package contains an init script but doesn't contain a %post with
a call to chkconfig.
"""
postin-without-chkconfig="""
The package contains an init script but doesn't call chkconfig in its
%post script.
"""
init-script-without-chkconfig-preun="""
The package contains an init script but doesn't contain a %preun with
a call to chkconfig.
"""
preun-without-chkconfig="""
The package contains an init script but doesn't call chkconfig in its
%preun script.
"""
missing-lsb-keyword="""
The package contains an init script that does not contain one of the LSB
init script comment block convention keywords that are recommendable for all
init scripts.  If there is nothing to add to a keyword's value, include the
keyword in the script with an empty value.  Note that as of version 3.2, the
LSB specification does not mandate presence of any keywords.
"""
no-status-entry="""
In your init script (/etc/rc.d/init.d/your_file), you don't
have a 'status' entry, which is necessary for good functionality.
"""
no-reload-entry="""
In your init script (/etc/rc.d/init.d/your_file), you don't
have a 'reload' entry, which is necessary for good functionality.
"""
no-chkconfig-line="""
The init script doesn't contain a chkconfig line to specify the runlevels
at which to start and stop it.
"""
no-default-runlevel="""
The default runlevel isn't specified in the init script.
"""
service-default-enabled="""
The service is enabled by default after 'chkconfig --add'; for security
reasons, most services should not be. Use '-' as the default runlevel in the
init script's 'chkconfig:' line and/or remove the 'Default-Start:' LSB keyword
to fix this if appropriate for this service.
"""
subsys-unsupported="""
The init script uses /var/lock/subsys which is not supported by
this distribution.
"""
subsys-not-used="""
While your daemon is running, you have to put a lock file in
/var/lock/subsys/. To see an example, look at this directory on your
machine and examine the corresponding init scripts.
"""
incoherent-subsys="""
The filename of your lock file in /var/lock/subsys/ is incoherent
with your actual init script name. For example, if your script name
is httpd, you have to use 'httpd' as the filename in your subsys directory.
It is also possible that rpmlint gets this wrong, especially if the init
script contains nontrivial shell variables and/or assignments. These
cases usually manifest themselves when rpmlint reports that the subsys name
starts a with '$'; in these cases a warning instead of an error is reported
and you should check the script manually.
"""
incoherent-init-script-name="""
The init script name should be the same as the package name in lower case,
or one with 'd' appended if it invokes a process by that name.
"""
init-script-name-with-dot="""
The init script name should not contain a dot in its name. Some versions
of chkconfig don't work as expected with init script names like that.
"""
init-script-non-executable="""
The init script should have at least the execution bit set for root
in order for it to run at boot time.
