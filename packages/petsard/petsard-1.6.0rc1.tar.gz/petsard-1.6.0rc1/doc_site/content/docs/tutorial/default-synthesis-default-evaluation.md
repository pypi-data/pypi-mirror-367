## Evaluation Overview

The evaluation of synthetic data requires balancing three key aspects:
1. Protection - assessing security level
2. Fidelity - measuring similarity with original data
3. Utility - evaluating practical performance

> Note: These three aspects often involve trade-offs. Higher protection might lead to lower fidelity, and high fidelity might result in lower protection.

## Evaluation Parameters

1. `Splitter`:
  - `num_samples: 1`: At least one validation group for evaluating privacy protection. This split is essential for Anonymeter to assess privacy risks by comparing training and testing data
  - `train_split_ratio: 0.8`: Split the dataset with 80% for training and 20% for testing, which is a common practice for cross-validation

2. `Evaluator`:
  - For linkability risk, `aux_cols` groups variables based on domain knowledge, such as personal demographic information and employment-related data
  - For inference risk, choose the most sensitive field (income) as the `secret` column
  - For classification utility, use the main `target` variable (income) that aligns with the actual analysis goal

## Evaluation Process

Follow these steps to evaluate your synthetic data:

1. **Data Validity Diagnosis** (using SDMetrics)
  - Goal: Ensure schema consistency
  - Standard: Diagnosis score should reach 1.0
  - Why: Valid data is the foundation for all subsequent analysis

2. **Privacy Protection Assessment** (using Anonymeter)
  - Goal: Verify privacy protection level
  - Standard: Risk score should be below 0.09
  - Evaluates: Singling out, linkability, and inference risks
  > Note: A risk score of 0.0 does NOT mean zero risk. Always implement additional protection measures.

3. **Application-Specific Assessment**

  Based on your use case, focus on either:

  A. No Specific Task (Data Release Scenario):
  - Focus on Data Fidelity (using SDMetrics)
  - Standard: Fidelity score above 0.75
  - Measures: Distribution similarity and correlation preservation

  B. Specific Task (Model Training Scenario):
  - Focus on Data Utility
  - Standards vary by task type:
    * Classification: ROC AUC > 0.8
    * Clustering: Silhouette > 0.5
    * Regression: Adjusted R² > 0.7
  > Note: ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve) measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes
