"""
When reprocessing is started, at first there are no stray light models. The L1-early flows processed during that
time will produce X files but no Q files. As models start to be generated, this script should be run to reset those
flows so the stray light-subtracted Q files can be generated. For each observatory/polarizer combo, this script will
report whether (1) we're still waiting for 2 stray light models, (2) We have >= 2 stray light models,
and some L1-early flows that produced X files but no Q files were found and reset, or (3) We have >= 2 stray light
models, and all X files have a corresponding Q file. Only when all polarizer/observatory combos report this third
state should the L1-late flow be enabled.
